                                        <p>I have made absolutely no secret of
                                        how much I disliked Disney's
                                        <em>Frozen</em>. I hated it. I spent
                                        most of the movie alternately
                                        facepalming, groaning, and checking my
                                        watch, and when people asked me how I
                                        liked it, I made this face:</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">As far
                                        as I could see, the problems were
                                        obvious. Just like <em>The Princess and
                                        the Frog</em>, I felt like Disney had
                                        started with some admirable intentions,
                                        but lost their gumption halfway through
                                        and covered up with cheap storytelling
                                        tricks and a lot of audience pandering.
                                        And when I told people how I felt about
                                        <em>The Princess and the Frog</em> (and
                                        <em>Brave</em>, for that matter-but
                                        we'll get to that), they mostly agreed
                                        with me. I don't make a habit of
                                        dogmatically disliking something just
                                        because I feel like it: usually if I
                                        have a viscerally negative reaction to
                                        a film, there's a healthy contingent of
                                        people out there who have the same
                                        reaction for much the same reasons.</p>

                                        <p>It was, therefore, a huge surprise
                                        to me just how many people <em>loved
                                        Frozen</em>. Not just loved, but
                                        slavered over it. Critics have been
                                        downright competitive in their

                                        own thoughts on the subject, I find one
                                        question persists:</p>

                                        <p><em>Were we even watching the same
                                        film?</em></p>

                                        <p>Everyone's entitled to their
                                        opinion. I certainly love some movies
                                        other people loathed; I'll even be
                                        referring to one of them in a few
                                        paragraphs. If your reason for liking
                                        <em>Frozen</em> is that it's fun, or
                                        the songs are catchy, or the animation
                                        is beautiful, or Olaf the Snowman is
                                        funny, then more power to you. But if
                                        you like <em>Frozen</em> because you
                                        think it is some revolutionary step
                                        forward in the way animated films
                                        portray women, then <em>I think you're
                                        wrong.</em> And unfortunately, when it
                                        comes to film's historically awful
                                        track record for portraying, hiring and
                                        being remotely fair to women,
                                        celebrating the wrong film-particularly
                                        in the sheer numbers that people are
                                        celebrating <em>Frozen</em>-has some
                                        very troublesome implications.</p>

                                        <p>My friends have asked for it and I
                                        feel like the internet needs it, so I'm
                                        going to go through, point-by-point and
                                        in no particular order, the top handful
                                        of reasons people have given for
                                        thinking <em>Frozen</em> is a feminist
                                        triumph, and I'm going to debunk them
                                        all.</p>

                                        <p>Here goes.</p>

                                        <p>I've heard a lot of people trumpet
                                        the fact that no one ended up married
                                        as some great progressive anomaly for
                                        Disney. The formula as we know it is so
                                        ingrained we don't even have to think.
                                        Whatever the heroine's dream, at some
                                        point she meets a man who helps her on
                                        her way, and the two fall in love just
                                        convincingly enough for the film to end
                                        on a shot of her in a giant meringue of
                                        a gown while bells ring and a carriage
                                        with ''Just Married'' on the back is
                                        driven away by a dozen white horses.
                                        But in <em>Frozen</em>, the man Anna
                                        decides she's going to marry in the
                                        first few minutes turns out to be a
                                        cad, and her relationship with her
                                        other love interest ends at their first
                                        kiss. It would be a sort-of-compelling
                                        argument, <em>if it were true</em>.</p>

                                        fairness, I did some digging. Of the 43

                                        distributed by Disney-how many do you
                                        think feature a wedding between anyone?
                                        Main characters, loveable sidekicks or
                                        one-scene supporting characters? All of

                                        features outnumber the ones with church

                                        films still outnumber the films with
                                        engagements or betrothals, and it
                                        certainly isn't nearly as heavily
                                        weighted towards betrothals as you'd
                                        expect. Secondly, look where Frozen
                                        ends up. It may ultimately be to the
                                        wrong guy, but Anna does spend most of
                                        the movie engaged, and that's important
                                        for two reasons: first, that if you
                                        count Aurora's betrothal to Phillip in
                                        <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>— and I know
                                        you do, despite that it happens when
                                        they're both infants and the fact that
                                        she falls in love with Phillip while
                                        disguised as a peasant is a total
                                        coincidence-then to be fair, you have
                                        to count Anna's engagement to Hans.
                                        Second…well, we'll get to that later,
                                        but for now let's say that Anna's
                                        engagement is significant to
                                        <em>her</em>, so it should be to us as
                                        well.</p>

                                        <p>In the interest of weighting this as
                                        far towards the perceived Disney mould
                                        as possible, I have one more table for
                                        you. In this one, I've put the animal
                                        features back in, and I'm now counting
                                        out every feature with a love story
                                        that ends in a happily ever after. A
                                        traditional, heterosexual happily ever
                                        after, I should qualify, though it's
                                        not like Disney is likely to actually
                                        attempt a same-sex love story any time
                                        soon. Or ever. Here's how that one
                                        tallies up:</p>

                                        <p>I would like to point out that I'm
                                        being <em>really</em> generous here. In
                                        the happily-ever-after column I've
                                        included multiple supporting character
                                        romances and a couple of really
                                        questionable selections (Simba's
                                        romantic relationship with Nala is just
                                        about the <em>least</em> important part
                                        of the climax of <em>The Lion
                                        King</em>, in <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>
                                        it's never clear whether Nani and David
                                        become more than friends, and in
                                        <em>Hunchback</em>, Quasimodo has to
                                        watch someone else get the girl). I
                                        will concede that when you're just
                                        looking at happily-ever-afters, more
                                        films are on-model than not. Having
                                        said that, <em>Frozen</em> falls into
                                        the happily-ever-after category far
                                        more tidily than several of the films I
                                        had to shoehorn in there.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">What's
                                        the point of all this? To illustrate
                                        right off the bat that
                                        <em>Frozen</em>'s defenders are finding
                                        things to celebrate about the film that
                                        just don't hold up. Looking at it
                                        strictly by the numbers,
                                        <em>Frozen</em> conforms to the
                                        expected Disney model. And I know
                                        there's a twist in the way the love
                                        story is presented, but I'll get to
                                        that. Dealing strictly with the ''But
                                        there's no wedding!'' argument, I have
                                        to call bullshit.</p>

                                        yes, yes it does. Granted, Elsa and

                                        them aren't about men, so yes,

                                        doesn't is <em>Aladdin</em>, and that's
                                        because Jasmine is the only speaking
                                        woman in the movie. Which, by the way,
                                        I'm not saying is a good thing; but
                                        whether <em>Aladdin</em> could have
                                        benefited from more female characters
                                        is another discussion entirely.</p>

                                        <p><em>Frozen</em> has two women in
                                        leading roles. It should pass the
                                        Bechdel test without effort; we
                                        shouldn't be surprised. What it lacks,
                                        however, that almost every other Disney
                                        princess movie has, is a roster of
                                        supporting female characters. Aside
                                        from Jasmine and Snow White (<em>Snow
                                        White</em> passes the Bechdel test by
                                        virtue of one conversation with the
                                        Queen near the end of the movie), all
                                        of Disney's heroines have strong female
                                        influences in their stories. Aurora is
                                        raised by three fairies; Belle
                                        befriends both Mrs Potts and her
                                        wardrobe; Pocahontas' best friend is
                                        another young woman and her strongest
                                        guiding influence is Grandmother
                                        Willow; even Mulan, who spends most of
                                        her movie solely in the company of men,
                                        begins the story surrounded by women.
                                        In <em>Brave</em>, Merida barely
                                        interacts with any male characters at
                                        all.</p>

                                        <p>I understand the nature of
                                        adaptation: characters change; some are
                                        cut and others are added; some are
                                        combined and others separated out.
                                        But-generally speaking, at least-it
                                        isn't Disney's habit to remove female
                                        characters from the source material in
                                        their adaptations. Particularly in the
                                        princess movies, young girls (and their
                                        mothers) make up such a huge slice of
                                        the target demographic-and therefore
                                        the box-office and merchandising
                                        profit-that diminishing the roles of
                                        the female supporting characters or
                                        switching them out for men would be an
                                        idiotic marketing decision. And, while
                                        I'm not suggesting that marketing is
                                        more important than strong narrative,
                                        in this case it does work in Disney's
                                        storytelling favour, providing a rich
                                        roster of maternal characters like Mrs
                                        Potts and Grandmother Willow. Remember
                                        that Disney heroines typically exist in
                                        extremely patriarchal environments, so
                                        inundating their narratives with
                                        ''strong'' women would seriously
                                        undermine their ongoing theme of
                                        subverting the assignations of those
                                        societies.</p>

                                        <p>Which leads me neatly back to
                                        <em>Frozen</em>, because
                                        <em>Frozen</em>'s setting is not
                                        explicity patriarchal. I don't know
                                        that having a queen instead of a king
                                        is necessarily <em>normal</em> in the
                                        world of <em>Frozen</em>, but Elsa's
                                        coronation certainly isn't treated as
                                        any kind of aberration. Women have
                                        enough respect and agency in this world
                                        that no one particularly comments on
                                        Arendelle's being ruled by a woman. No
                                        one speculates about whom she's going
                                        to marry or how many sons she's going
                                        to bear; for once, in fact, it's the
                                        man (Hans) who has to marry into
                                        royalty to have any real power.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I'm
                                        not saying that I disapprove of
                                        adaptation, or that I think that Disney
                                        generally takes too many liberties when
                                        adapting stories. Hell, I love what
                                        they did with Hamlet. But the original
                                        story of <em>The Snow Queen</em> has
                                        strong female character after strong
                                        female character, from the grandmother
                                        who tells Gerda (the original story's
                                        Anna) stories of the Snow Queen, to the
                                        Robber Girl who wants to be Gerda's
                                        friend, to the Princess who-get
                                        this-can't find a suitor because she
                                        refuses to marry a man who can't keep
                                        up with her intellectually. It's too
                                        many characters for one Disney film,
                                        with far too many subplots and
                                        intersecting storylines, but it also
                                        really begs the question…for what was
                                        clearly supposed to be its most
                                        feminist animated film ever, adapted
                                        into one of its least patriarchal
                                        settings, why would Disney replace this
                                        entire lineup of interesting female
                                        characters <em>with men</em>?</p>

                                        <p>Elsa and Anna might be two female
                                        characters in leading roles, but
                                        they're also the only women in the
                                        whole film. The original story doesn't
                                        so much pass the Bechdel test as run
                                        rings around it; <em>Frozen</em> barely
                                        scrapes a pass. And, while there's
                                        definitely a marketing logic behind
                                        having some fun male supporting roles
                                        the boys can enjoy, there is nothing to
                                        praise in replacing every single female
                                        supporting role from the story with a
                                        male analogue. Why did Anna need a male
                                        companion, if both plucky comic relief
                                        characters were male? Or vice-versa:
                                        female reindeer grow antlers, so Sven
                                        could have been a female without even
                                        changing the aesthetic.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">
                                        Narratively speaking, I think
                                        <em>Frozen</em> made wrong choice after
                                        wrong choice, and I've no great love
                                        for any of the characters, so I can't
                                        honestly say how I'd have fixed it
                                        without changing the story entirely.
                                        But I can say that praising the film
                                        for passing the Bechdel test is
                                        meaningless in the face of 1) the
                                        number of its predecessors that also
                                        pass just as comfortably, and 2) the
                                        fantastic supporting cast of female
                                        characters from the original story that
                                        Disney cast aside in favour of
                                        surrounding Elsa and Anna with men. The
                                        only reason to give Anna a male
                                        travelling companion-that I can think
                                        of-is to uphold the traditional love
                                        story that everyone is so convinced the
                                        film subverts.</p>

                                        protagonists!</h3>

                                        <p>No it isn't. This is where I really
                                        start to take issue with all the
                                        effusive praise being heaped on the
                                        film. I'll address the ''two
                                        protagonist'' issue a few paragraphs
                                        from now-trust me, it's more relevant
                                        there-but I really worry about this
                                        pervasive conviction that Anna and Elsa
                                        are ''strong'' characters. Leaving
                                        aside for the moment all the women that
                                        <em>Frozen</em> could have included
                                        (see above), let's take a good, hard
                                        look at both main characters, beginning
                                        with Anna.</p>

                                        <p>Quick, what defines Anna? She's
                                        beautiful, in a
                                        gives-Barbie-body-dysmorphia kind of
                                        way. That's par for the course with
                                        Disney heroines, except for Merida and
                                        Mulan. She's clumsy, which would be
                                        endearing except that it seems to be
                                        the de facto flaw for heroines who
                                        aren't fully-developed enough to have a
                                        real flaw-and yes, this would be the
                                        point where I compare <em>Frozen</em>
                                        to <em>Twilight</em>. Anna's clumsiness
                                        doesn't move the plot. It doesn't
                                        affect the outcome of…anything, really.
                                        It isn't something she has to
                                        overcome-like Mulan does-thereby
                                        displaying strength or determination.
                                        It's just a trait she has so that we
                                        will find her more approachable: a
                                        cold, hard, marketing decision.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">What
                                        else does Anna have going for her? She
                                        isn't intelligent, no matter how many
                                        words she can spit out per minute. If
                                        she were, she wouldn't rush into an
                                        engagement with Hans, nor-for that
                                        matter-leave a man she barely knows in
                                        charge of her kingdom while she rides
                                        out in the snow without a coat. She's
                                        certainly self-absorbed, using the
                                        first opportunity to make Elsa's
                                        coronation all about her; and she's
                                        vain, believing absolutely in her
                                        ability to talk some sense into Elsa
                                        despite having had no relationship with
                                        her sister for what looks like roughly
                                        ten years. She has no awareness of her
                                        surroundings (riding out in the snow
                                        without a coat), no awareness of her
                                        own limitations (the cringe-inducing
                                        mountain climbing episode), and no
                                        awareness of the consequences of her
                                        actions (provoking Elsa not once, but
                                        twice). She's outspoken, yes, but she's
                                        also rude; she's condescending towards
                                        Kristoff and belligerent towards her
                                        sister; and she has no ambition beyond
                                        finding her one true love-more on that

                                        <p>When it comes to women I'd look up
                                        to or consider role models, especially
                                        for young girls, Anna ranks somewhere
                                        around <em>Mean Girls</em>' Karen
                                        Smith, and certainly well below bookish
                                        Belle, feisty Merida, determined Tiana
                                        or even kindly Cinderella. I certainly
                                        didn't spend the movie thinking how
                                        approachable Anna was, as so many other
                                        young women breathlessly profess to; I
                                        spent it wanting to grab her by the
                                        pigtails, give her a good shake, and
                                        tell her to wake up and smell the
                                        snowflakes.</p>

                                        <p>Running from her problems once is
                                        one thing. Elsa is far from the first
                                        Disney character to believe-even
                                        correctly-that s/he has done something
                                        terrible, and to attempt to outrun the
                                        consequences. But Simba, faced with the
                                        reality of the harm he has inflicted on
                                        the Pride Lands, makes the conscious,
                                        independent choice to turn around and
                                        set things right, while Quasimodo
                                        literally brings the walls of Notre
                                        Dame down around him to right his
                                        wrongs. Faced with her misdeeds, Elsa
                                        sets a golem on her sister and has to
                                        be dragged back to Arendelle in chains
                                        when she's knocked unconscious by her
                                        own chandelier. This is not a strong
                                        woman. This is a frightened, repressed,
                                        vulnerable woman who starts running at
                                        the beginning of the movie and doesn't
                                        stop until her sister literally turns
                                        to ice in front of her.</p>

                                        <p>So what does Elsa have going for

                                        warm up a little (pun definitely
                                        intended). But her redemption is an
                                        unearned arc. She never says-never even
                                        intimates-that she <em>wants</em> to
                                        right the wrong she's done. She just
                                        wants to run from it. She's more
                                        intelligent than Anna, but only barely;
                                        she's anti-social; and she also has
                                        little to no awareness of the
                                        consequences of her actions: especially
                                        troubling since even a small amount of
                                        ice-conjuring probably messes the local
                                        eco-system up pretty badly.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">
                                        There's an ongoing problem, I think,
                                        with ''strong female character'' being
                                        made synonymous with ''any fictional
                                        woman who isn't just window dressing''.
                                        There's a whole argument to be made
                                        about why the phrase ''<a href=

                                        and of itself-after all, do you ever
                                        hear a writer set out specifically to
                                        write a ''strong male character''?-but
                                        I think that that's what going on with
                                        <em>Frozen</em>. Because both
                                        characters are arguably leads, and
                                        neither is reduced to talking
                                        production design, we are conditioned
                                        to see them both as ''strong'', whether
                                        or not they actually are.
                                        <em>Frozen</em> certainly has two
                                        female characters. It even arguably has
                                        two <em>lead</em> female characters.
                                        But it certainly doesn't have two
                                        <em>strong</em> female characters, and
                                        two out of three just isn't enough to
                                        justify all the praise.</p>

                                        kingdom far too quickly to want to do
                                        right by her subjects, so she can't
                                        want to be a good queen. If my life
                                        depended on intentifying Elsa's motive,
                                        I'd probably settle on ''live free from
                                        fear'', but that's starting to get
                                        pretty abstract for a Disney
                                        princess.</p>

                                        <p>There's a particular pattern that
                                        I've noticed in Disney animated
                                        features. Disney princesses state what
                                        they want, usually very early in the
                                        film, and they tend to get it. Belle
                                        wants to escape her provincial life,
                                        and that's exactly what she does.
                                        Rapunzel wants to figure out what the
                                        glowing lights mean, and again: that's
                                        exactly what she does, discovering her
                                        whole hidden history in the process.
                                        Mulan wants to bring honour to her
                                        family, and she ends up bringing honour
                                        to the whole of China. Even Ariel, who
                                        of all the recent Disney princesses is
                                        the most criticised for a lack of
                                        ambition outside of love, wants to
                                        experience life as a human long before
                                        she meets Eric. Tiana wants a
                                        restaurant, Pocahontas wants to choose
                                        her own path, Jasmine wants to escape
                                        the confines of patriarchal law; the
                                        list goes on. And the men in these
                                        stories? They're the <em>bonus
                                        prizes</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

                                        about your typical male-dominated
                                        action or adventure movie. The man sets
                                        out to save the kingdom, find the Holy
                                        Grail, slay the dragon, or whatever it
                                        is that drives his story. The hero
                                        accomplishes his goal, and it's usually
                                        pretty much a given that he finds love
                                        along the way. The social contract in a
                                        male-driven movie is that he is offered
                                        a woman <a href=

                                        bonus prize</a>; no matter how aloof or
                                        damaged or resistant she is, the hero
                                        will win her over and claim her love.
                                        It's a shitty social contract, but
                                        that's what we expect it to be.</p>

                                        <p>In Disney princess movies, that
                                        social contract is turned precisely on
                                        its head. The princess starts her story
                                        with a goal or dream. She undergoes
                                        trials and tests in pursuit of that
                                        dream, usually making new friends along
                                        the way. Once she achieves that
                                        dream-which she invariably does-she is
                                        usually given a prince as a reward
                                        (notable exceptions include
                                        <em>Pocahontas</em> and
                                        <em>Brave),</em> the prince more often
                                        than not being one of the friends she
                                        has met along the way.</p>

                                        <p>If it sounds simplistic, it's
                                        because it is. No matter how much
                                        Disney animated films may appeal to
                                        adults, their target demographic is
                                        still children-and usually children
                                        under the age of twelve. For stories
                                        that are essentially morality tales,
                                        simplicity is a benefit. So the heroine
                                        states her goal within the first
                                        fifteen minutes of the movie, usually
                                        in the Menken-styled ''I want'' song,
                                        and that means that everyone in the
                                        audience knows precisely when to cheer
                                        at the end of the movie. Ariel wants to
                                        be human, so we cheer when Triton gives
                                        her her legs; Mulan wants to bring
                                        honour to her family, so we cheer when
                                        she returns home with the Emperor's
                                        gifts; Belle wants ''adventure in the
                                        great, wide somewhere'', and oh boy,
                                        does she get what she asked for.
                                        Pocahontas chooses her own path, Merida
                                        changes her fate, Tiana gets her
                                        restaurant, and so on.</p>

                                        She wants to find ''the one''. And,

                                        these are the bonus prizes. Anna's real
                                        goal is true love. We know this for

                                        heroine before her, she helpfully tells
                                        us so in her first scene as an adult.
                                        Her ''I want'' song is all about
                                        finding a man and falling in love; she
                                        doesn't even mention her sister. As far
                                        as I can tell, she can't get away from
                                        Elsa and everything she represents fast

                                        a bit messed up!</h3>

                                        <p>No need to get defensive about it,
                                        but yes, a little social awkwardness is
                                        probably to be expected for a girl
                                        who's lived in almost total isolation
                                        for…three years. Yes, I'm extrapolating
                                        a little here: we certainly don't see
                                        Anna interact with anyone aside from
                                        her sister and parents until Elsa's
                                        coronation. But think about it
                                        logically. After the ice incident as
                                        children, Elsa may be isolated-both by
                                        her parents and by her own fear-but
                                        there's no reason for the King and
                                        Queen to isolate Anna too. They almost
                                        certainly still have official functions
                                        to attend to: we know from Elsa's
                                        coronation that the monarch is
                                        responsible for negotiating trade
                                        arrangements and treaties, so it would
                                        be extremely irresponsible for the King
                                        and Queen to hole themselves away like
                                        their daughter. Seeing what enforced
                                        isolation does to Elsa, does it seem
                                        likely that they would force the same
                                        upon their non-powered daughter?</p>

                                        seems far more likely that Anna is only

                                        years pass between that and Elsa's
                                        coronation. Three long, lonely, boring
                                        years, I'm sure, but three years that
                                        seem to send Anna far further
                                        off-balance than lifetimes of isolation
                                        do to other Disney princesses. Unlike,
                                        say, Rapunzel, Jasmine or Aurora, Anna
                                        has spent some fifteen years of her
                                        life in relative normality, presumably
                                        experiencing culture, friendships, and
                                        perhaps even her first crush in that
                                        time: all the things a normal
                                        aristocratic teenager could expect to
                                        experience. And even in the three years
                                        spent shut in the castle, what about
                                        the servants? Given Anna's natural
                                        boisterousness, unless Arendelle is
                                        <em>really</em> classist, I find it
                                        hard to imagine she didn't interact
                                        with and even make friends among the
                                        castle staff, whom we know exist
                                        because frankly it's far more
                                        believable than Elsa and Anna doing
                                        their own laundry.</p>

                                        skillet. Even Belle compensates for her
                                        social isolation by reading voraciously
                                        about the wide world around her. Anna
                                        has to endure three years of-at

                                        emerges so desperate for love that she
                                        gets engaged to literally the first

                                        to do; it's ridiculous because a girl

                                        already have a crush on a cute

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Elsa
                                        is just as big an idiot as her sister.
                                        I've already gone over most of the
                                        problems I have with Elsa, so I'll try
                                        to keep this one fairly brief. We've
                                        established that she's repressed, that
                                        she's a perfect storm (pun again
                                        intended) of avoidance and anti-social
                                        personality disorders, that she runs
                                        from her problems, and so on. It
                                        doesn't take a political scientist to
                                        figure out the ramifications of a
                                        newly-crowned queen fleeing her
                                        kingdom, yet Elsa doesn't even consider
                                        the potential power vacuum, nor the
                                        consequences for Anna. And when forced,
                                        even momentarily, to face the reality
                                        of her actions, she overreacts like a
                                        tantrum-throwing child, even setting a
                                        homicidal snow-golem on her sister in
                                        her desperation to avoid
                                        responsibility.</p>

                                        that's what ''okay to be an
                                        individual'' looks like, sign me up for
                                        the herd. Elsa's attempt to claim her
                                        identity results in her almost killing
                                        her sister and plunging Arendelle into
                                        an eternal winter. Elsa doesn't claim
                                        individuality: she seeks isolation, as
                                        total as possible. She has no wish to
                                        be accepted, whether for who she is or
                                        not-only to be alone. And even though,
                                        at the very end, it looks as though the
                                        people of Arendelle have accepted her,
                                        mutant abilities and all, it certainly
                                        isn't because she asked for it. If I'm
                                        honest, I have no idea why it is at
                                        all. The film certainly doesn't offer
                                        much of an explanation. At any rate,
                                        even if Elsa's arc is intended to be a
                                        ringing endorsement of accepting your
                                        individuality, even if it means
                                        isolation, it certainly doesn't convey
                                        that successfully. Claiming your right
                                        to self-expression is one thing, but
                                        <em>Frozen</em> seems to be equating
                                        that with resolutely avoiding
                                        responsibility for your actions, and to
                                        be advocating both equally.</p>

                                        <p>Aside from all that, I suppose the
                                        real point here is that Elsa isn't a
                                        <em>villain</em> in the traditional
                                        sense. We do expect Disney films to
                                        have a clear-cut villain against whom
                                        the warriors of good can fight, and
                                        Disney has quite a roster of really
                                        <em>fantastic</em> villains. Bucking
                                        that trend and making Elsa a more
                                        relatable character is an interesting
                                        choice. But again, biased memory seems
                                        to be obscuring the fact that complex
                                        villains-and even nonexistent
                                        villains-are not new for Disney. Frollo
                                        is the go-to example of a
                                        multi-dimensional Disney antagonist,
                                        motivated as he is by fanatical
                                        religious belief; but even the more
                                        mustache-twirling of the Disney
                                        antagonists often have some pretty good
                                        reasons for being that way. Take Scar,
                                        for example, neglected as a cub in
                                        favour of his perfect older brother; or
                                        Shere Khan, fearful of humans because
                                        <em>dear God, have you seen
                                        Bambi?</em></p>

                                        <p>More to the point, even the most
                                        mustache-twirling, conventionally
                                        <em>evil</em> of Disney's villains
                                        often exist in worlds with many, many
                                        shades of gray. In <em>The Fox and the
                                        Hound</em>, Amos Slade may be the
                                        nominal villain, but the real conflict
                                        is in the way Tod and Copper's
                                        preassigned roles almost destroy their
                                        friendship. In <em>Bambi</em>, the
                                        villain is the abstract notion of Man,
                                        and in <em>Brother Bear</em>, the
                                        nominal hero of the story starts out by
                                        murdering the mother of the character
                                        who will become his best friend and
                                        adoptive brother. It's pretty messed
                                        up, but it is complex and
                                        thought-provoking.</p>

                                        <p>Elsa isn't a villain, but frankly
                                        she isn't that complex, either. In
                                        story meetings for <em>Frozen</em>, the
                                        writers decided that the theme of the
                                        story was <a href=

                                        vs. fear</em></a>, but by deciding on
                                        that binary they actually ended up
                                        robbing the film of a lot of the
                                        complexity a character like Elsa could
                                        have brought to it. Even Disney films
                                        with the most abhorrently evil of
                                        villains frequently explore extremely
                                        morally ambiguous territory, dealing
                                        with topics like guilt, honour,
                                        societal expectations, revenge,
                                        responsibility and honesty. In
                                        <em>Frozen</em>, the morality is
                                        simple: <em>fear=bad; love=good</em>.
                                        In a story already that binary, who
                                        needs a villain anyway?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Yeesh.
                                        Here's a rat's nest of contradictions.
                                        So let's get this out of the way first:
                                        yes, there is clearly something to the
                                        notion of Elsa shedding her
                                        buttoned-up, traditional Arendelle
                                        attire for something a little more
                                        free-flowing that (at least
                                        aesthetically) suits her character. And
                                        yes, I'm exactly the kind of woman that
                                        will defend to the death my right to
                                        wear a miniskirt and heels and still
                                        call myself a feminist. I don't have a
                                        particular problem with women being
                                        sexualised on screen, either: as long
                                        as they aren't <em>objectified</em>, I
                                        don't think there's anything wrong with
                                        celebrating that the female body can be
                                        a beautiful thing that is very
                                        appealing to show off.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">But
                                        good lord, that costume. I defy anyone
                                        to tell me Elsa's new wardrobe isn't
                                        <em>entirely</em> aesthetically
                                        motivated. And I'm not just talking
                                        about its being pretty, which it
                                        undoubtedly is. I'm talking about its
                                        being laughably, <em>astonishingly</em>
                                        impractical. Her dress is so narrow
                                        that she can barely walk in it, and
                                        speaking of not being able to walk…</p>

                                        <em>Look at those things.</em> I have
                                        five-inch spike heels that look more
                                        comfortable than that. When you imagine
                                        a wardrobe change that represents
                                        empowerment and independence, do you
                                        really picture crystalline spikes right
                                        at your toe and heel joints? I'll grant
                                        you that the fantasy superhero version
                                        of me wears heels, but they're heels on
                                        nice, sturdy leather boots that won't
                                        cut my feet to shreds and don't require
                                        a toe grip of death just to keep them
                                        on my damn feet. For a woman who lives
                                        in a palace of ice, she doesn't seem to
                                        have put any kind of grip on her soles,
                                        and have you ever tried to wear
                                        stilettos in the snow? It ends with
                                        falling on your ass. I respect the idea
                                        behind showing Elsa's <em>choice</em>
                                        in how she dresses herself, but that
                                        idea gets seriously muddled when our
                                        strong female character
                                        <em>chooses</em> to dress herself in a
                                        way that makes it near impossible to do
                                        anything but stand and look
                                        ornamental.</p>

                                        is Jena Malone's costume from Zack
                                        Snyder's much-maligned <em>Sucker
                                        Punch</em>. <em>Sucker Punch</em> got
                                        raked over the coals for portraying its
                                        lead female characters as ''male
                                        fantasy masturbation fodder'' (multiple
                                        sources), and yes, however you feel
                                        about the film, there is no mistaking
                                        the body baring, fetishistic nature of
                                        Malone's costume up there. When asked
                                        about her character's costume-which,
                                        like Elsa's, is the product of its
                                        wearer's imagination-Malone's response,
                                        paraphrased, boils down to, ''If you're
                                        fantasising about kicking ass, killing
                                        dragons and saving the day, aren't you
                                        also imagining yourself looking sexy
                                        and beautiful doing it?'' It's a
                                        different wording of the same defence
                                        of Elsa's costume, but here's the
                                        difference: in the <em>Sucker
                                        Punch</em> costume, Malone can
                                        <em>move</em>. It might not be sweats
                                        and a t-shirt, but it doesn't restrict
                                        any important joints, and, while those
                                        boots have a bit of a heel, they also
                                        have grip on the soles and they
                                        certainly won't be slipping off her
                                        feet. Fetishised as the costume is, it
                                        is also practical enough for some truly
                                        superb stuntwork, and the costume
                                        designer actually consulted with Malone
                                        during training to ensure that the
                                        costume never interfered with the
                                        character's stated purpose of kicking
                                        some serious ass.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I'm
                                        not defending <em>Sucker Punch</em>.
                                        It's a muddled mess of a film-I may
                                        have loved it, but certainly not in a
                                        way that compels me to defend it. But
                                        there's a ridiculous double standard
                                        going on here. In <em>Frozen</em>, Elsa
                                        minces around in a slit-to-there
                                        sequined number that she can barely
                                        walk in, with a cute little pair of

                                        sexualised yet far more practical
                                        costume from <em>Sucker Punch</em>, the
                                        internet pats her on the head and says,
                                        ''Aww, it's sweet that you think you
                                        know what you're talking about''. The
                                        world decided it hated <em>Sucker
                                        Punch</em>, so the fact that Malone
                                        trained for months and could basically
                                        bench press an elephant <em>while
                                        wearing</em> her Rocket costume took
                                        second place to the fact that we could
                                        see her underwear. The world decided it
                                        loved <em>Frozen</em>, so it chose to
                                        ignore the fact that if Elsa so much as
                                        took a particularly wide step we'd be
                                        able to see her underwear too.</p>

                                        <h3>There's an openly gay character!
                                        With a family!</h3>

                                        <p>This one went all over the internet
                                        quite quickly, and until very recently
                                        I actually wrote it off as a joke.
                                        Let's make one thing quite clear:
                                        Disney is <em>never</em> going to
                                        actually feature an openly gay couple
                                        in an animated film, even as supporting
                                        characters (never mind as heroes). It
                                        breaks my heart to say it, but a
                                        massive amount of Disney's box-office
                                        dollars and merchandise sales comes
                                        from the very right-wing, and that goes
                                        all the way back to Walt himself. While
                                        he was fairly adamant about avoiding
                                        depictions of Christianity in the early
                                        films, favouring magic and mythology
                                        instead for a more inclusive audience,
                                        Walt Disney was equally as adamant
                                        about his films conforming to
                                        traditional family values, and that has
                                        been an unofficial but steadfast part
                                        of the company's mission statement ever
                                        since.</p>

                                        <p>So, with that in mind, who on earth
                                        is this openly gay character I managed
                                        to miss? Twice? I've heard the theory
                                        that Elsa's ''Let it Go'' is subtly
                                        intended as a coming-out anthem of
                                        sorts, but there's no confirmation from
                                        Disney of that, so I'm inclined to
                                        believe it's one of those convenient
                                        Disney moments the LGBT community can
                                        adopt with pride whether Disney wants
                                        them to or not (something of which I
                                        wholeheartedly approve, by the way).
                                        And yes, Elsa doesn't end up with a man
                                        of her own-which I'll cover in a few
                                        paragraphs-but if not ending the film
                                        with a heterosexual romantic interest
                                        is supposed to automatically out Elsa
                                        as a lesbian, then frankly Disney's
                                        just doing it wrong.</p>

                                        <p>No, the apparently gay character
                                        that, at least according to the
                                        internet, is such a revolutionary step
                                        forwards for Disney, is…</p>

                                        <p>Yes, he speaks like an effete

                                        apparently Disney was being really
                                        explicit here, not just dealing in
                                        ambiguously offensive stereotypes. No,
                                        the logic behind everyone believing
                                        that Oaken (he of the Trading Post-and

                                        <p>Showing openly gay characters in
                                        mainstream animated movies is not new,
                                        but it is very, <em>very</em> recent.
                                        The first and <em>only</em> mainstream
                                        animated film to explicitly state that
                                        a major character is gay is Laika's
                                        <em>Paranorman</em>, released in 2012,
                                        with Mitch, the less-than-genius jock
                                        with crazy biceps and a boyfriend who
                                        loves chick flicks. <em>Paranorman</em>
                                        didn't just break new ground by having
                                        an openly gay character: it made the
                                        absolutely deliberate decision not to
                                        treat Mitch's homosexuality as a
                                        special-interest case. He's a jock with
                                        a boyfriend. Norman is a misfit who can
                                        speak to dead people. Judge Hopkins is
                                        a zombie with a guilt complex. It's an
                                        entire story full of strange and
                                        unusual characters, and Mitch's
                                        homosexuality is one of the least
                                        noteworthy traits any of these
                                        characters have.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I am
                                        an outspoken advocate of the idea that
                                        homosexuality needs to start being
                                        treated in mainstream movies like it
                                        isn't a big deal. As long as
                                        films-animated or otherwise-with LGBT
                                        characters keep being categorised as
                                        special interest pieces, we won't
                                        really have equality in media, no
                                        matter how many LGBT characters find
                                        their way onto the screen. That was
                                        what I loved about <em>Paranorman</em>:
                                        that Mitch's sexuality ain't no thing.
                                        That's what people seem to love about
                                        the shot of Oaken's maybe-family: that

                                        <p>But there is a crucial difference
                                        here: in <em>Paranorman</em>, the

                                        comment on Mitch's homosexuality. If
                                        anyone was left with any doubts at the
                                        end of the film, those doubts are
                                        erased when screenwriter/co-director

                                        a brave and decisive move, and it
                                        resulted in some of the absolute
                                        ugliest reactions I have ever seen. To
                                        the minds of so many viewers, an
                                        animated film that handled the
                                        treatment of a homosexual major
                                        character perfectly suddenly became
                                        about the gay agenda and nothing else.
                                        Laika brushed it off and continued with
                                        its wonderfully inclusive teaser
                                        trailer for <em>The Boxtrolls</em>, but
                                        Laika doesn't have the market share to
                                        lose that Disney does. If Disney were
                                        even to confirm that Oaken is
                                        gay-thereby also confirming that his
                                        having a husband is too normal to
                                        justify comment-the support they would
                                        gain from the already-supportive gay
                                        community would pale in comparison to
                                        the support they would lose from what
                                        is still their largest market segment:
                                        right-wing families with Volvos and
                                        two-and-a-half children.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">And
                                        that's why Disney will never take that
                                        risk. Perhaps Oaken is supposed to be
                                        gay. I doubt it-I think seeing a
                                        husband in that sauna is just
                                        confirmation bias. But it doesn't
                                        matter, because it's a freeze-frame
                                        gag, and no one from Disney is ever
                                        going to confirm or deny. If you're
                                        that eager for a gay character in a
                                        mainstream animated movie, go watch
                                        <em>Paranorman</em> instead; but you
                                        cannot persuade me to believe that a
                                        freeze-frame gag that may or may not be
                                        of a homosexual family is anything
                                        worth celebrating, because it isn't. It
                                        is not <em>good enough.</em></p>

                                        <p>Oh, and do we ever. It's actually
                                        one of the few moments in the film I
                                        enjoyed: when Anna falls over herself
                                        with enthusiasm for her whirlwind
                                        engagement to Hans, and Elsa reacts
                                        with unfettered horror. We've
                                        established that Anna is an idiot, but
                                        at least the voice of reason is
                                        somewhere in the room. We later hear
                                        the same words echoed by Kristoff-a
                                        lot-and, in a different form, by Hans
                                        himself when he reveals his true
                                        colours.</p>

                                        <p>It's a lambasting of the Disney
                                        princess tradition, and theoretically a
                                        fairly incisive one. You shouldn't
                                        marry a man you just met. It's
                                        unquestionably stupid, and poking fun
                                        at the fact that Disney has been
                                        not-so-subtly encouraging that approach
                                        for decades is a smart move. I mean,
                                        come on: how many Disney princesses or
                                        leading ladies have fallen in love at
                                        first sight with a man they barely
                                        know?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Four.
                                        That's how many. Rather than boring you
                                        with more tables, I'll just name them:
                                        Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora and
                                        Ariel. Disney ladies actually tend
                                        towards quite extended courtships, and
                                        the men are more likely to fall in love
                                        at first sight than the women are. Each
                                        of the four love-at-first-sight
                                        princesses have love interests who fall
                                        just as quickly as they do-Ariel's
                                        Prince Eric falls in love with a girl
                                        he just <em>heard</em>-and you can add
                                        Aladdin, Quasimodo, Hercules and Tarzan
                                        to the list of men who let their eyes
                                        do the thinking for them (more if you
                                        count the animal characters).</p>

                                        <p>So Anna is warned off committing to
                                        a guy she just met, in an attempt to
                                        criticise something that isn't actually
                                        as longstanding a Disney tradition as
                                        everyone thinks it is, and what does
                                        she go off and do? Fall in love with a
                                        guy she just met.</p>

                                        <p>Look at the film's timeline. The
                                        castle gates open mid-morning, and Hans
                                        is pretty much the first person Anna
                                        meets. After their dance, which I'm
                                        guessing is somewhere around noon, they
                                        spend the rest of the day together, not
                                        announcing their engagement until at
                                        least eleven at night (the clock
                                        halfway through their duet reads
                                        10:15). They get a full day together,
                                        which, given that they spend most of it
                                        talking, is actually quite a lot of
                                        getting-to-know-you time. Not, I grant
                                        you, nearly enough to justify getting
                                        engaged, but a normal, sane person can
                                        certainly develop real feelings for
                                        another normal, sane person in eleven
                                        hours of talking.</p>

                                        actually spend with Kristoff? The
                                        timeline of the film gets more muddled
                                        from here, so I'm guessing a little,
                                        but I do know that Kristoff and Anna
                                        leave Oaken's Trading Post (and Sauna)
                                        sometime in the early morning (Oaken's

                                        than fifteen minutes since Anna and
                                        Hans had their little duet, but unless
                                        Elsa's eternal winter has changed the
                                        rotation of the earth, it should still
                                        be light out by 10:30 am in July-but I
                                        digress), and that Kristoff drops
                                        ailing Anna back in Arendelle fairly
                                        early the next morning. At best, the
                                        two have just over twenty-four hours
                                        together, most of which is spent either
                                        navigating hostile terrain or sniping
                                        at each other; yet the audience is
                                        expected to believe that they have
                                        fallen in ''true love'' with each other
                                        in that time. It doesn't matter that
                                        the act of true love ends up being
                                        between Anna and Elsa (and yes, I'll be
                                        hitting that beat later too): the twist
                                        only works because we believe that what
                                        Anna and Kristoff have is real.</p>

                                        show of hands-who actually thought Elsa
                                        was the protagonist of the story? She
                                        isn't. She's the antagonist. An
                                        antagonist who gets a redemption and
                                        who isn't necessarily a

                                        nonetheless. <em>Frozen</em> is
                                        unquestionably Anna's story, and almost
                                        every scene Elsa has is there to
                                        prevent the real protagonist-Anna-from
                                        getting what she wants. Sure, we get a
                                        few moments alone with Elsa to flesh
                                        her out, but I'm going to court
                                        controversy here by saying that ''Let
                                        it Go'', while undoubtedly a fun song,
                                        is just Elsa's equivalent to Frollo's
                                        ''Hellfire'': time spent giving the
                                        antagonist enough complexity to keep
                                        him/her interesting. It doesn't make
                                        Elsa the hero of the story: it just
                                        makes us want to see her thrown off a
                                        cliff a little less.</p>

                                        plenty of female antagonists before:
                                        Maleficent, Cruella De Vil, Ursula,

                                        far more nuanced and compelling than
                                        any of these ladies. I'm just saying
                                        that not giving her a love interest is
                                        much more conventional than actually
                                        giving her one would have been.</p>

                                        Does she suppress her power for her

                                        love and power, or can she find a way

                                        Kiss</strong>™?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Two.
                                        <em>Snow White</em> and <em>Sleeping
                                        Beauty</em>. Disney has been cleverly
                                        subverting the True Love's Kiss trope
                                        for over fifty years. Ariel misses her
                                        True Love's Kiss and has to earn her
                                        right to be a human instead; Belle
                                        doesn't kiss the Beast until
                                        <em>after</em> he transforms
                                        (thankfully, or think of the
                                        hairballs), and Pocahontas' True Love's
                                        Kiss kiss literally gets people killed.
                                        In <em>The Princess and the Frog</em>,
                                        the trope is subverted far more
                                        cleverly than in <em>Frozen</em>, when
                                        the kiss that will transform Naveen
                                        back is revealed to be a matter of
                                        semantics, not love. Naveen could have
                                        saved himself by kissing any old
                                        princess, whether he loved her or not:
                                        it is not until he and Tiana have
                                        married for the <em>right reasons</em>
                                        that their kiss has any meaning,
                                        literally or figuratively.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">That
                                        being said, the choice to make Anna's
                                        and Elsa's love for each other what
                                        will save the day, rather than Anna's
                                        and Hans', is an admirable one. Really,
                                        it is. It just isn't nearly as
                                        surprising or revolutionary as everyone
                                        seems to think it is. The climaxes of
                                        Disney movies hinge on family,
                                        friendship, truth and honour just as
                                        often as they do on love. Disney has
                                        never, ever been shy about telling its
                                        audience that there are many more types
                                        of love than just romantic. Consider
                                        <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>, <em>The Fox
                                        and the Hound, The Lion King, Robin
                                        Hood, Brother Bear, Tarzan, The Black
                                        Cauldron…</em>quick, someone stop me
                                        before I list three-quarters of all the
                                        films Disney has ever made.</p>

                                        <p>Because of the youth of its target
                                        demographic, Disney actually beats the
                                        drum of friendship far more often than
                                        that of True Love. Even in <em>The
                                        Little Mermaid</em>-and yes, I'm going
                                        to keep coming back to it because
                                        everyone's convinced it is so much more
                                        benighted than it is-it is
                                        <em>Triton'</em>s love for Ariel that
                                        eventually gives her what she wants,
                                        not Eric's. When she acts like a
                                        petulant teenager with a crush (which
                                        she is), Ariel can't really escape the
                                        ocean to the human life she so craves;
                                        but when she fights for her father's
                                        trust and respect, literally saving his
                                        life in the process, she achieves her
                                        goal. Just as I said a few paragraphs
                                        ago, her marriage to Eric is the bonus
                                        prize, and it isn't remotely accidental
                                        that her last line in the entire film
                                        is ''I love you, <em>Daddy</em>.''</p>

                                        <p>Plenty of Disney films, even the
                                        princess ones, tell us that family and
                                        friendship are just as important as-if
                                        not more than-romantic love.
                                        <em>Frozen</em> is the only one I can
                                        think of with so little respect for its
                                        audience that it has to beat us over
                                        the head with it.</p>

                                        decisions!</h3>

                                        <p>I've been saving this one until last
                                        for a reason, so fasten your seatbelts
                                        and make sure you're in a comfy chair.
                                        I haven't exactly been subtle about how
                                        little I like Anna and Elsa as
                                        characters. I think they're both rash,
                                        impulsive, myopic idiots who overreact
                                        to everything and make all the wrong
                                        decisions. But there's something to be
                                        said for a female character who is not
                                        only allowed but encouraged to make her
                                        own decisions, right? Even if those
                                        decisions are monumentally stupid?</p>

                                        <p>Well, yeah, of course there is. Now
                                        show me that character.</p>

                                        <p>I will grant you that Anna takes the
                                        initiative a couple of times. She
                                        decides to ride off after her
                                        totally-not-dangerous-except-really-she-is
                                        sister. She insists that Kristoff
                                        escort her up the mountain right then
                                        and there, instead of (more sensibly)
                                        after they have both eaten and rested.
                                        She…no, wait, that's it.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Anna
                                        actually spends a lot of the movie
                                        being told what she can and cannot do.
                                        Hard as she fights for it, her
                                        engagement to Hans isn't her idea: it's
                                        his. And it's a decision that has
                                        nothing to do with her well-being,
                                        desires or happiness, and everything to
                                        do with his ulterior motives. Hans
                                        manipulates Anna into marrying him;
                                        Elsa tells Anna she can't get married.
                                        When Anna stands her ground against
                                        Elsa in her ice palace, Elsa forces her
                                        out, first with magic and then with the
                                        unnecessarily aggressive golem. Anna is
                                        not permitted to deduce what act of
                                        true love might save her failing heart:
                                        a troll tells her it must be true
                                        love's kiss, after which one man
                                        literally carries her back to Arendelle
                                        so that another man can kiss her
                                        better. Throughout the film, Anna has
                                        very little agency.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">It
                                        actually goes a step further. Anna
                                        doesn't just have decisions made for
                                        her as she goes: her agency is actively
                                        taken from her within the first few
                                        minutes of the film. Without her
                                        consent-without even her parents' real
                                        consent-Anna has her memories of Elsa's
                                        power taken away as a small child. We
                                        understand that Anna is unconscious and
                                        unable to consent, and that the
                                        procedure will save her life, but what
                                        happens next? If, when she is old
                                        enough to understand the implications,
                                        her parents or even Elsa were to sit
                                        her down and say, ''Look, there's
                                        something you should know about your
                                        sister, <em>for your own safety and
                                        hers</em>,'' would the ice in her head
                                        grow back? Or would she just then be
                                        equipped with information that could
                                        help her sister retain control, or
                                        prevent her from making some really
                                        stupid decisions later on?</p>

                                        <p>Before she rides off to reason with
                                        Elsa, Anna makes two statements. The
                                        first is that Elsa is not dangerous;
                                        the second is that Elsa would never
                                        hurt her. The sentiment is nice-and
                                        clearly groundwork for Anna's act of
                                        unconditional sibling love later on-but
                                        both those statements are
                                        fundamentally, <em>dangerously</em>
                                        untrue. However good Elsa's intentions,
                                        the fact is that she <em>is</em>
                                        dangerous, and she <em>can</em> hurt
                                        Anna. A lot of Anna's poor choices are
                                        motivated by sheer stupidity, but in
                                        this case that lack of information
                                        prevents her from making good
                                        decisions. Her agency is compromised,
                                        and it puts her in very real danger.
                                        Knowing Elsa's ability is
                                        uncontrollable under strong emotion,
                                        would Anna have provoked her at the
                                        coronation, or confronted her in the
                                        ice palace? Knowing the effect of being
                                        struck by Elsa's power, would Anna have
                                        gone to see her alone, or continued
                                        pushing her despite her obvious
                                        distress?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I know

                                        decison-making here, but it's worth
                                        noting that the Troll King is fairly
                                        egalitarian in whose agency he chooses
                                        to ruin, doing a pretty comprehensive
                                        number on Elsa's ability to control her
                                        life as well. Think about it: to a
                                        vulnerable young girl already terrified
                                        by the reality of having harmed her
                                        sister, the Troll King basically says,
                                        ''Fear will be your greatest
                                        enemy…BOO!''</p>

                                        seriously, though, regardless of how
                                        badly Elsa and Anna's parents interpret
                                        the Troll King's warning, the damage is
                                        already done. The Troll King steals
                                        Elsa's agency too, by needlessly
                                        scaring the living shit out of both her
                                        and her parents. They are frightened,
                                        they are vulnerable and they are
                                        desperate, and so the Troll King
                                        decides to tell them about Elsa's
                                        growing powers in the most frightening
                                        and ominous way he possibly could,
                                        indelibly equating Elsa's ability with
                                        the very fear she needs to avoid. More
                                        than that, we find out later that the
                                        Troll King is very aware of the potency
                                        of love to temper Elsa's power: he's
                                        the one who tells Anna later on that
                                        true love can thaw the ice in her
                                        heart. The only reason he does not tell
                                        Elsa about the power of love right away
                                        is because it would result in a much
                                        shorter movie. As it is, his reticence
                                        not only robs Elsa of her freedom to
                                        study, understand, and ultimately
                                        control her powers: it leads to a story
                                        predicated on a plot contrivance so
                                        thin it's invisible from sideways
                                        on.</p>

                                        <p><strong>It gets worse.</strong></p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Maybe
                                        it's a cultural thing, but those trolls
                                        have a serious and recurring problem
                                        with the ideas of choice, agency and
                                        consent-all things we rightfully expect
                                        that our heroes should have. Having
                                        already got both Anna's and Elsa's
                                        lives off to fantastic starts when they
                                        were both children, the trolls continue
                                        to step all over Anna's choices when
                                        Kristoff brings her to them for advice.
                                        What should be a straightforward
                                        info-dump turns into an awkward and
                                        frankly obnoxious song-and-dance number
                                        in which the trolls try to convince
                                        Anna, Kristoff, and us that Anna and
                                        Kristoff belong together, despite the
                                        fact that Anna is already engaged.</p>

                                        <p>I know the point of Anna's whirlwind
                                        engagement to Hans is to poke fun at
                                        the notion of love at first sight, but
                                        think about it contextually for a
                                        moment: the trolls know literally
                                        nothing about Hans and how recently
                                        Anna met him. For all they know, Anna's
                                        fiance is someone she has been courting
                                        for years, and with whom she is deeply,
                                        genuinely in love. In fact, as
                                        Kristoff's friend and clearly someone
                                        he respects enough to introduce to his
                                        family, the trolls have every reason to
                                        give Anna the benefit of the doubt and
                                        <em>assume</em> her engagement is
                                        something to which she has given
                                        careful, considered thought. So what is
                                        their immediate reaction to being told
                                        that she is engaged to another man?</p>

                                        <p><em>We can fix that.</em></p>

                                        <p>Do me a favour, and imagine you're a
                                        recently engaged woman. Now imagine
                                        your best friend invites you over to
                                        his house, and his mother assumes that
                                        you and he are a couple. Embarrassed,
                                        but understanding the mistake, you tell
                                        her that you are engaged to someone
                                        else. ''Don't be silly,'' she says,
                                        ''that doesn't matter. You're going to
                                        marry my son.'' How offended would you
                                        be?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I know
                                        it's supposed to be a fun little comedy
                                        beat, but the trolls' response to the
                                        news of Anna's engagement shows no
                                        respect for her choices, or her agency
                                        as an individual. She doesn't know
                                        what's best for herself (and yes, I
                                        know technically that's true, but work
                                        with me here): a bunch of people she
                                        met five minutes ago know better. She
                                        isn't asked whether she'd prefer to be
                                        with Kristoff: it's assumed. When she
                                        tries to interject, she is cut off. And
                                        what's worse is that <em>we agree with
                                        the trolls</em>. That moment reads as
                                        comedic because the audience isn't
                                        expected to respect Anna's agency
                                        either. We've already assumed she'll
                                        end up with Kristoff. <em>We've made
                                        the choice for her too</em>.</p>

                                        scene, so neatly hidden in a jazzy
                                        little song-and-dance number that I
                                        actually missed it the first time
                                        around. And, just like Hans, the trolls
                                        don't suggest the match with Kristoff
                                        for Anna's benefit. The song is about
                                        how she can fix <em>him</em>. Her only
                                        qualification for the job is being a
                                        woman. Anna's interest in Kristoff is
                                        assumed-and again, imagine being told
                                        by someone you barely know that you
                                        really are attracted to a man: you just
                                        don't know it yet. It's deeply
                                        offensive; and yet, once again, we're
                                        expected to agree with the trolls,
                                        because that's just how these stories
                                        work.</p>

                                        this leads up to Anna only escaping
                                        being married to Kristoff <em>without
                                        her consent</em> by almost dying from a
                                        heart condition. You forgot about that
                                        detail, didn't you? I cannot think of a
                                        single other Disney movie in which a
                                        character gets all the way to ''I now
                                        pronounce you…'' without giving some
                                        kind of consent…actually, that's not
                                        quite true. In <em>The Little
                                        Mermaid</em>, Prince Eric is
                                        brainwashed into marrying Ursula, and
                                        is halfway through the ceremony before
                                        Ariel and her animal friends rescue
                                        him. His blank stare, Ursula's evil
                                        smile, the music, the atmosphere: every
                                        detail in that scene is an indicator of
                                        how utterly <em>wrong</em> the
                                        situation is. A non-consensual marriage
                                        is the closest Disney animation will
                                        ever get to showing us a rape. Eric's
                                        almost-wedding to Ursula is the most
                                        extreme example I can think of, but
                                        plenty of Disney movies involve women
                                        trapped by the prospect of an arranged
                                        marriage, and <em>without
                                        exception</em> those women fight that
                                        disregard for their consent. We are
                                        expected to feel and support their
                                        horror; their revulsion; their feeling
                                        of violation.</p>

                                        Civil Rights Act of 1964. The state of
                                        the industry for women is absolutely
                                        abysmal, and has been for decades. It's
                                        a problem that should have been swiftly

                                        time, it was. The male-led studios
                                        didn't want women behind the cameras,
                                        so they did their best to keep them
                                        out. But now? It's just complacency. In
                                        the years following the 1978 EEOC
                                        report, the percentage of women behind
                                        the cameras did start to rise, peaking
                                        with 16% of network television episodes
                                        directed by women in 1993. And then? It
                                        plateaued. Someone, somewhere, decided

                                        as bleak as ever, but because no one
                                        wants to disturb the status quo, and
                                        because twenty years ago it was decided
                                        that we had reached <em>good
                                        enough</em>, virtually nothing is being
                                        done. The same is true in finance; the
                                        same is true in engineering. The same

                                        for racial discrimination or LGBT
                                        acceptance. Every minority group that

                                        mediocre and recover with the next
                                        installment in the franchise, but the
                                        debate over which superheroine should
                                        kick off the women-driven slate of
                                        films has been going on for years,
                                        because the zeitgeist of the industry
                                        means that <em>she will only get one
                                        shot.</em></p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">We
                                        like to think that animated movies are
                                        almost as egregious as superhero films.
                                        I've tried over and over again here to
                                        show that that isn't historically the
                                        case, but for whatever reason the
                                        perception persists. Throwing the doors
                                        open to women with a new generation of
                                        intelligent, capable female characters
                                        who are not defined by whom they fall
                                        in love with is a smart move, and
                                        Disney knows it. That's why Disney has
                                        been beating the ''More Feminism'' drum
                                        for years now: not because they believe
                                        it, but because the children of
                                        millenials are being brought up in
                                        homes that champion intelligent,
                                        outspoken women, and that's where the
                                        ticket sales are coming from. But
                                        Disney has, and has always had, a fine
                                        line to tread between breaking new
                                        ground, and maintaining the comfort of
                                        tradition, or it risks losing the
                                        millions in ticket sales and
                                        merchandise that comes from the old
                                        vanguard. <em>Frozen</em> walks that
                                        line like a tightrope, but not by
                                        actually breaking new ground. Instead,
                                        <em>Frozen</em> creates the clever
                                        illusion of its own progressiveness by
                                        subtly degrading what came before it to
                                        make itself look more enlightened by
                                        comparison. In doing so, it not only
                                        treads upon a rich history of
                                        compelling heroines in much better
                                        films; it manages to get away with
                                        being <em>good enough</em>.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">At the
                                        end of the day, that's why I feel it's
                                        so important to call <em>Frozen</em> on
                                        its bullshit. Whether you loved or
                                        hated <em>Frozen</em>, it should be
                                        impossible to deny that it is preceded
                                        by a rich history of animated films
                                        that champion bravery, intelligence,
                                        strength and agency in their heroines
                                        far more effectively than it does. Yet
                                        denying it we are, in droves, and
                                        sometime since <em>Frozen</em>'s
                                        release the praise heaped upon it
                                        reached such a critical mass that it
                                        somehow has made us forget that Belle
                                        left both home and the Beast's castle
                                        to save her father's life; that Mulan
                                        risked death on the battlefield and
                                        execution for treason to protect her
                                        family; that Esmeralda chose immolation
                                        rather than give herself to a man she
                                        despised; that the archetypal Prince
                                        Charming hasn't been seen in a Disney
                                        film since <em>The Little Mermaid</em>;
                                        and that no Disney heroine except
                                        Anna-even Ariel-has begun her story
                                        with love as her goal <em>since
                                        1959</em>: all in favour of vapid,
                                        brainless, impulsive and flighty
                                        characters whose agency is stolen from
                                        them for the sake of comedy and
                                        wafer-thin plot contrivances. This is
                                        Disney's <em>good enough</em>.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">And
                                        just like the DGA's slight rise in
                                        women directors twenty years ago,
                                        <em>good enough</em> is where Disney
                                        will stay. Record-breaking box office
                                        numbers and glowing reviews give Disney
                                        our permission to stamp the
                                        <em>Frozen</em> formula with FEMINIST,
                                        wash their hands, and go home. And you
                                        cannot fault them for it. Since its
                                        earliest days as a studio, Disney has
                                        been a for-profit business. Their track
                                        record puts them firmly in the camp of
                                        what will make them money: it's the
                                        only reason they don't produce
                                        hand-drawn features any more. At the
                                        same time that Disney's hand-drawn
                                        animation department was failing
                                        commercially, Pixar was practically
                                        printing its own money with computer
                                        animated features. Over the course of
                                        just two years, we decided with our box
                                        office dollars that the
                                        traditionally-animated <em>Princess and
                                        the Frog</em> was not <em>good
                                        enough</em>, but that the CGI
                                        <em>Tangled</em> was, and the great
                                        tradition of hand-drawn Disney features
                                        died, probably for good.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">I
                                        don't want <em>Frozen</em> to be
                                        <em>good enough</em>. I've spent more
                                        than enough words explaining why I
                                        think it spits in the face of what we
                                        should be thinking of as feminism, and
                                        how, like a schoolyard bully, it
                                        ennobles itself by mocking its
                                        predecessors. I don't want to think
                                        that, when I perhaps have daughters
                                        some day, this is what I will be able
                                        to take them to see; still less do I
                                        want to think that the older, more
                                        progressive features will have been
                                        deemed irrelevant in favour of the new,
                                        <em>Frozen-</em>style model. I applaud
                                        the <em>attempt</em> to broaden the
                                        range of multi-faceted female
                                        characters in animation; I appreciate
                                        the <em>intent</em> of having two women
                                        in prominent roles instead of the usual
                                        one, but I want to see <em>better</em>.
                                        And the more effusive praise we heap on
                                        a movie that shouldn't even be <em>good
                                        enough</em>, the less likely it is that
                                        <em>better</em> will ever happen.</p>
