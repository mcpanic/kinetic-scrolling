                                        <p>I have made absolutely no secret of
                                        how much I disliked Disney's
                                        <em>Frozen</em>. I hated it. I spent
                                        most of the movie alternately
                                        facepalming, groaning, and checking my
                                        watch, and when people asked me how I
                                        liked it, I made this face:</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">As far
                                        as I could see, the problems were
                                        obvious. Just like <em>The Princess and
                                        the Frog</em>, I felt like Disney had
                                        started with some admirable intentions,
                                        but lost their gumption halfway through
                                        and covered up with cheap storytelling
                                        tricks and a lot of audience pandering.
                                        And when I told people how I felt about
                                        <em>The Princess and the Frog</em> (and
                                        <em>Brave</em>, for that matter-but
                                        we'll get to that), they mostly agreed
                                        with me. I don't make a habit of
                                        dogmatically disliking something just
                                        because I feel like it: usually if I
                                        have a viscerally negative reaction to
                                        a film, there's a healthy contingent of
                                        people out there who have the same
                                        reaction for much the same reasons.</p>

                                        <p>It was, therefore, a huge surprise
                                        to me just how many people <em>loved
                                        Frozen</em>. Not just loved, but
                                        slavered over it. Critics have been
                                        downright competitive in their
                                        effusiveness, calling it ''<a href=

                                        ''feminist'', ''revolutionary'',
                                        ''subversive'' and a hundred other
                                        buzzwords that make it sound as though
                                        <em>Frozen</em> has done for female
                                        characters what <em>Brokeback
                                        Mountain</em> did for gay cowboys. And
                                        after reading glowing review after
                                        glowing review, taking careful
                                        assessment of all the points made, and
                                        some very deep navel-gazing about my
                                        own thoughts on the subject, I find one
                                        question persists:</p>

                                        <p><em>Were we even watching the same
                                        film?</em></p>

                                        <p>Everyone's entitled to their
                                        opinion. I certainly love some movies
                                        other people loathed; I'll even be
                                        referring to one of them in a few
                                        paragraphs. If your reason for liking
                                        <em>Frozen</em> is that it's fun, or
                                        the songs are catchy, or the animation
                                        is beautiful, or Olaf the Snowman is
                                        funny, then more power to you. But if
                                        you like <em>Frozen</em> because you
                                        think it is some revolutionary step
                                        forward in the way animated films
                                        portray women, then <em>I think you're
                                        wrong.</em> And unfortunately, when it
                                        comes to film's historically awful
                                        track record for portraying, hiring and
                                        being remotely fair to women,
                                        celebrating the wrong film-particularly
                                        in the sheer numbers that people are
                                        celebrating <em>Frozen</em>-has some
                                        very troublesome implications.</p>

                                        <p>My friends have asked for it and I
                                        feel like the internet needs it, so I'm
                                        going to go through, point-by-point and
                                        in no particular order, the top handful
                                        of reasons people have given for
                                        thinking <em>Frozen</em> is a feminist
                                        triumph, and I'm going to debunk them
                                        all.</p>

                                        <p>Here goes.</p>

                                        <h3 class="notes-source-hasnotes">There
                                        was no wedding at the end of the
                                        film.</h3>

                                        <p>I've heard a lot of people trumpet
                                        the fact that no one ended up married
                                        as some great progressive anomaly for
                                        Disney. The formula as we know it is so
                                        ingrained we don't even have to think.
                                        Whatever the heroine's dream, at some
                                        point she meets a man who helps her on
                                        her way, and the two fall in love just
                                        convincingly enough for the film to end
                                        on a shot of her in a giant meringue of
                                        a gown while bells ring and a carriage
                                        with ''Just Married'' on the back is
                                        driven away by a dozen white horses.
                                        But in <em>Frozen</em>, the man Anna
                                        decides she's going to marry in the
                                        first few minutes turns out to be a
                                        cad, and her relationship with her
                                        other love interest ends at their first
                                        kiss. It would be a sort-of-compelling
                                        argument, <em>if it were true</em>.</p>

                                        <em>Seven.</em> Seven Disney films show
                                        a wedding on-screen, or feature two
                                        characters getting married within the
                                        timeline of the movie. Here's the table
                                        to prove it:</p>

                                        <p>Surprising, isn't it? With the
                                        number of animal features to account
                                        for, you'd expect a bit of an
                                        imbalance, but the wedding-less
                                        features outnumber the ones with church
                                        bells by a shocking five to one. Snow
                                        White? No marriage, no betrothal; she
                                        just hops on the prince's horse and
                                        rides off with him. Sleeping Beauty?
                                        They dance and her dress changes
                                        colour. Beauty and the Beast ends with
                                        the exact same dance scene as Sleeping
                                        Beauty, and Pocahontas watches her
                                        beloved sail back to England.</p>

                                        even the playing field, let's remove
                                        the completely irrelevant movies, by
                                        which I mean the ones that involve

                                        godawful we all prefer to pretend they
                                        don't exist. I'm also broadening my
                                        definition of the Disney formula to
                                        include betrothals and engagements as
                                        well as weddings:</p>

                                        <p>There are a couple of things of note
                                        here. Firstly, while it's a much more
                                        even distribution, the engagement-free
                                        films still outnumber the films with
                                        engagements or betrothals, and it
                                        certainly isn't nearly as heavily
                                        weighted towards betrothals as you'd
                                        expect. Secondly, look where Frozen
                                        ends up. It may ultimately be to the
                                        wrong guy, but Anna does spend most of
                                        the movie engaged, and that's important
                                        for two reasons: first, that if you
                                        count Aurora's betrothal to Phillip in
                                        <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> and I know
                                        you do, despite that it happens when
                                        they're both infants and the fact that
                                        she falls in love with Phillip while
                                        disguised as a peasant is a total
                                        coincidence-then to be fair, you have
                                        to count Anna's engagement to Hans.
                                        Second ...well, we'll get to that later,
                                        but for now let's say that Anna's
                                        engagement is significant to
                                        <em>her</em>, so it should be to us as
                                        well.</p>

                                        <p>In the interest of weighting this as
                                        far towards the perceived Disney mould
                                        as possible, I have one more table for
                                        you. In this one, I've put the animal
                                        features back in, and I'm now counting
                                        out every feature with a love story
                                        that ends in a happily ever after. A
                                        traditional, heterosexual happily ever
                                        after, I should qualify, though it's
                                        not like Disney is likely to actually
                                        attempt a same-sex love story any time
                                        soon. Or ever. Here's how that one
                                        tallies up:</p>

                                        <p>I would like to point out that I'm
                                        being <em>really</em> generous here. In
                                        the happily-ever-after column I've
                                        included multiple supporting character
                                        romances and a couple of really
                                        questionable selections (Simba's
                                        romantic relationship with Nala is just
                                        about the <em>least</em> important part
                                        of the climax of <em>The Lion
                                        King</em>, in <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>
                                        it's never clear whether Nani and David
                                        become more than friends, and in
                                        <em>Hunchback</em>, Quasimodo has to
                                        watch someone else get the girl). I
                                        will concede that when you're just
                                        looking at happily-ever-afters, more
                                        films are on-model than not. Having
                                        said that, <em>Frozen</em> falls into
                                        the happily-ever-after category far
                                        more tidily than several of the films I
                                        had to shoehorn in there.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">What's
                                        the point of all this? To illustrate
                                        right off the bat that
                                        <em>Frozen</em>'s defenders are finding
                                        things to celebrate about the film that
                                        just don't hold up. Looking at it
                                        strictly by the numbers,
                                        <em>Frozen</em> conforms to the
                                        expected Disney model. And I know
                                        there's a twist in the way the love
                                        story is presented, but I'll get to
                                        that. Dealing strictly with the ''But
                                        there's no wedding!'' argument, I have
                                        to call bullshit.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Why
                                        yes, yes it does. Granted, Elsa and
                                        Anna only actually have four
                                        conversations as adults, but three of
                                        them aren't about men, so yes,
                                        <em>Frozen</em> does pass the test.</p>

                                        <p>You know which other Disney princess
                                        movies pass the Bechdel test? <em>Most

                                        of them pass</a>. The only one that
                                        doesn't is <em>Aladdin</em>, and that's
                                        because Jasmine is the only speaking
                                        woman in the movie. Which, by the way,
                                        I'm not saying is a good thing; but
                                        whether <em>Aladdin</em> could have
                                        benefited from more female characters
                                        is another discussion entirely.</p>

                                        <p><em>Frozen</em> has two women in
                                        leading roles. It should pass the
                                        Bechdel test without effort; we
                                        shouldn't be surprised. What it lacks,
                                        however, that almost every other Disney
                                        princess movie has, is a roster of
                                        supporting female characters. Aside
                                        from Jasmine and Snow White (<em>Snow
                                        White</em> passes the Bechdel test by
                                        virtue of one conversation with the
                                        Queen near the end of the movie), all
                                        of Disney's heroines have strong female
                                        influences in their stories. Aurora is
                                        raised by three fairies; Belle
                                        befriends both Mrs Potts and her
                                        wardrobe; Pocahontas' best friend is
                                        another young woman and her strongest
                                        guiding influence is Grandmother
                                        Willow; even Mulan, who spends most of
                                        her movie solely in the company of men,
                                        begins the story surrounded by women.
                                        In <em>Brave</em>, Merida barely
                                        interacts with any male characters at
                                        all.</p>

                                        <p>I understand the nature of
                                        adaptation: characters change; some are
                                        cut and others are added; some are
                                        combined and others separated out.
                                        But-generally speaking, at least-it
                                        isn't Disney's habit to remove female
                                        characters from the source material in
                                        their adaptations. Particularly in the
                                        princess movies, young girls (and their
                                        mothers) make up such a huge slice of
                                        the target demographic-and therefore
                                        the box-office and merchandising
                                        profit-that diminishing the roles of
                                        the female supporting characters or
                                        switching them out for men would be an
                                        idiotic marketing decision. And, while
                                        I'm not suggesting that marketing is
                                        more important than strong narrative,
                                        in this case it does work in Disney's
                                        storytelling favour, providing a rich
                                        roster of maternal characters like Mrs
                                        Potts and Grandmother Willow. Remember
                                        that Disney heroines typically exist in
                                        extremely patriarchal environments, so
                                        inundating their narratives with
                                        ''strong'' women would seriously
                                        undermine their ongoing theme of
                                        subverting the assignations of those
                                        societies.</p>

                                        <p>Which leads me neatly back to
                                        <em>Frozen</em>, because
                                        <em>Frozen</em>'s setting is not
                                        explicity patriarchal. I don't know
                                        that having a queen instead of a king
                                        is necessarily <em>normal</em> in the
                                        world of <em>Frozen</em>, but Elsa's
                                        coronation certainly isn't treated as
                                        any kind of aberration. Women have
                                        enough respect and agency in this world
                                        that no one particularly comments on
                                        Arendelle's being ruled by a woman. No
                                        one speculates about whom she's going
                                        to marry or how many sons she's going
                                        to bear; for once, in fact, it's the
                                        man (Hans) who has to marry into
                                        royalty to have any real power.</p>

                                        not saying that I disapprove of
                                        adaptation, or that I think that Disney
                                        generally takes too many liberties when
                                        adapting stories. Hell, I love what
                                        they did with Hamlet. But the original
                                        story of <em>The Snow Queen</em> has
                                        strong female character after strong
                                        female character, from the grandmother
                                        who tells Gerda (the original story's
                                        Anna) stories of the Snow Queen, to the
                                        Robber Girl who wants to be Gerda's
                                        friend, to the Princess who-get
                                        this-can't find a suitor because she
                                        refuses to marry a man who can't keep
                                        up with her intellectually. It's too
                                        many characters for one Disney film,
                                        with far too many subplots and
                                        intersecting storylines, but it also
                                        really begs the question ...for what was
                                        clearly supposed to be its most
                                        feminist animated film ever, adapted
                                        into one of its least patriarchal
                                        settings, why would Disney replace this
                                        entire lineup of interesting female
                                        characters <em>with men</em>?</p>

                                        <p>Elsa and Anna might be two female
                                        characters in leading roles, but
                                        they're also the only women in the
                                        whole film. The original story doesn't
                                        so much pass the Bechdel test as run
                                        rings around it; <em>Frozen</em> barely
                                        scrapes a pass. And, while there's
                                        definitely a marketing logic behind
                                        having some fun male supporting roles
                                        the boys can enjoy, there is nothing to
                                        praise in replacing every single female
                                        supporting role from the story with a
                                        male analogue. Why did Anna need a male
                                        companion, if both plucky comic relief
                                        characters were male? Or vice-versa:
                                        female reindeer grow antlers, so Sven
                                        could have been a female without even
                                        changing the aesthetic.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">
                                        Narratively speaking, I think
                                        <em>Frozen</em> made wrong choice after
                                        wrong choice, and I've no great love
                                        for any of the characters, so I can't
                                        honestly say how I'd have fixed it
                                        without changing the story entirely.
                                        But I can say that praising the film
                                        for passing the Bechdel test is
                                        meaningless in the face of 1) the
                                        number of its predecessors that also
                                        pass just as comfortably, and 2) the
                                        fantastic supporting cast of female
                                        characters from the original story that
                                        Disney cast aside in favour of
                                        surrounding Elsa and Anna with men. The
                                        only reason to give Anna a male
                                        travelling companion-that I can think
                                        of-is to uphold the traditional love
                                        story that everyone is so convinced the
                                        film subverts.</p>

                                        protagonists!</h3>

                                        <p>No it isn't. This is where I really
                                        start to take issue with all the
                                        effusive praise being heaped on the
                                        film. I'll address the ''two
                                        protagonist'' issue a few paragraphs
                                        from now-trust me, it's more relevant
                                        there-but I really worry about this
                                        pervasive conviction that Anna and Elsa
                                        are ''strong'' characters. Leaving
                                        aside for the moment all the women that
                                        <em>Frozen</em> could have included
                                        (see above), let's take a good, hard
                                        look at both main characters, beginning
                                        with Anna.</p>

                                        <p>Quick, what defines Anna? She's
                                        beautiful, in a
                                        gives-Barbie-body-dysmorphia kind of
                                        way. That's par for the course with
                                        Disney heroines, except for Merida and
                                        Mulan. She's clumsy, which would be
                                        endearing except that it seems to be
                                        the de facto flaw for heroines who
                                        aren't fully-developed enough to have a
                                        real flaw-and yes, this would be the
                                        point where I compare <em>Frozen</em>
                                        to <em>Twilight</em>. Anna's clumsiness
                                        doesn't move the plot. It doesn't
                                        affect the outcome of ...anything, really.
                                        It isn't something she has to
                                        overcome-like Mulan does-thereby
                                        displaying strength or determination.
                                        It's just a trait she has so that we
                                        will find her more approachable: a
                                        cold, hard, marketing decision.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">What
                                        else does Anna have going for her? She
                                        isn't intelligent, no matter how many
                                        words she can spit out per minute. If
                                        she were, she wouldn't rush into an
                                        engagement with Hans, nor-for that
                                        matter-leave a man she barely knows in
                                        charge of her kingdom while she rides
                                        out in the snow without a coat. She's
                                        certainly self-absorbed, using the
                                        first opportunity to make Elsa's
                                        coronation all about her; and she's
                                        vain, believing absolutely in her
                                        ability to talk some sense into Elsa
                                        despite having had no relationship with
                                        her sister for what looks like roughly
                                        ten years. She has no awareness of her
                                        surroundings (riding out in the snow
                                        without a coat), no awareness of her
                                        own limitations (the cringe-inducing
                                        mountain climbing episode), and no
                                        awareness of the consequences of her
                                        actions (provoking Elsa not once, but
                                        twice). She's outspoken, yes, but she's
                                        also rude; she's condescending towards
                                        Kristoff and belligerent towards her
                                        sister; and she has no ambition beyond
                                        finding her one true love-more on that
                                        below.</p>

                                        <p>When it comes to women I'd look up
                                        to or consider role models, especially
                                        for young girls, Anna ranks somewhere
                                        around <em>Mean Girls</em>' Karen
                                        Smith, and certainly well below bookish
                                        Belle, feisty Merida, determined Tiana
                                        or even kindly Cinderella. I certainly
                                        didn't spend the movie thinking how
                                        approachable Anna was, as so many other
                                        young women breathlessly profess to; I
                                        spent it wanting to grab her by the
                                        pigtails, give her a good shake, and
                                        tell her to wake up and smell the
                                        snowflakes.</p>

                                        self-repression later, because that
                                        isn't actually her fault, but this is a
                                        woman who steadfastly refuses to accept
                                        any help offered to her. Her sister
                                        spends the better part of ten years
                                        trying to reach out to her (admittedly
                                        misguidedly), and Elsa shuts herself
                                        away so steadfastly a psychiatrist

                                        <p>Running from her problems once is
                                        one thing. Elsa is far from the first
                                        Disney character to believe-even
                                        correctly-that s/he has done something
                                        terrible, and to attempt to outrun the
                                        consequences. But Simba, faced with the
                                        reality of the harm he has inflicted on
                                        the Pride Lands, makes the conscious,
                                        independent choice to turn around and
                                        set things right, while Quasimodo
                                        literally brings the walls of Notre
                                        Dame down around him to right his
                                        wrongs. Faced with her misdeeds, Elsa
                                        sets a golem on her sister and has to
                                        be dragged back to Arendelle in chains
                                        when she's knocked unconscious by her
                                        own chandelier. This is not a strong
                                        woman. This is a frightened, repressed,
                                        vulnerable woman who starts running at
                                        the beginning of the movie and doesn't
                                        stop until her sister literally turns
                                        to ice in front of her.</p>

                                        <p>So what does Elsa have going for

                                        warm up a little (pun definitely

                                        unearned arc. She never says-never even
                                        intimates-that she <em>wants</em> to
                                        right the wrong she's done. She just
                                        wants to run from it. She's more
                                        intelligent than Anna, but only barely;
                                        she's anti-social; and she also has
                                        little to no awareness of the
                                        consequences of her actions: especially
                                        troubling since even a small amount of

                                        There's an ongoing problem, I think,
                                        with ''strong female character'' being
                                        made synonymous with ''any fictional
                                        woman who isn't just window dressing''.
                                        There's a whole argument to be made
                                        about why the phrase ''<a href=

                                        and of itself-after all, do you ever
                                        hear a writer set out specifically to
                                        write a ''strong male character''?-but
                                        I think that that's what going on with
                                        <em>Frozen</em>. Because both
                                        characters are arguably leads, and
                                        neither is reduced to talking
                                        production design, we are conditioned
                                        to see them both as ''strong'', whether
                                        or not they actually are.
                                        <em>Frozen</em> certainly has two
                                        female characters. It even arguably has
                                        two <em>lead</em> female characters.
                                        But it certainly doesn't have two
                                        <em>strong</em> female characters, and
                                        two out of three just isn't enough to
                                        justify all the praise.</p>

                                        else. Let's start with Elsa, for once.
                                        What is her goal? Does she even have
                                        one?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">It
                                        can't be ''be accepted for who I am'',
                                        because she isolates herself
                                        completely; it isn't ''learn to control
                                        my power'', because she never studies
                                        her power so much as she runs away from
                                        what destabilises her. She never
                                        expresses any particular wish to be
                                        closer to Anna, nor does she lust after
                                        power or eternal winter. She leaves her
                                        kingdom far too quickly to want to do
                                        right by her subjects, so she can't
                                        want to be a good queen. If my life
                                        depended on intentifying Elsa's motive,
                                        I'd probably settle on ''live free from
                                        fear'', but that's starting to get
                                        pretty abstract for a Disney
                                        princess.</p>

                                        <p>There's a particular pattern that
                                        I've noticed in Disney animated
                                        features. Disney princesses state what
                                        they want, usually very early in the
                                        film, and they tend to get it. Belle
                                        wants to escape her provincial life,
                                        and that's exactly what she does.
                                        Rapunzel wants to figure out what the
                                        glowing lights mean, and again: that's
                                        exactly what she does, discovering her
                                        whole hidden history in the process.
                                        Mulan wants to bring honour to her
                                        family, and she ends up bringing honour
                                        to the whole of China. Even Ariel, who
                                        of all the recent Disney princesses is
                                        the most criticised for a lack of
                                        ambition outside of love, wants to
                                        experience life as a human long before
                                        she meets Eric. Tiana wants a
                                        restaurant, Pocahontas wants to choose
                                        her own path, Jasmine wants to escape
                                        the confines of patriarchal law; the
                                        list goes on. And the men in these
                                        stories? They're the <em>bonus
                                        prizes</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

                                        about your typical male-dominated
                                        action or adventure movie. The man sets
                                        out to save the kingdom, find the Holy
                                        Grail, slay the dragon, or whatever it
                                        is that drives his story. The hero
                                        accomplishes his goal, and it's usually
                                        pretty much a given that he finds love
                                        along the way. The social contract in a
                                        male-driven movie is that he is offered
                                        a woman <a href=

                                        will win her over and claim her love.
                                        It's a shitty social contract, but
                                        that's what we expect it to be.</p>

                                        <p>In Disney princess movies, that
                                        social contract is turned precisely on
                                        its head. The princess starts her story
                                        with a goal or dream. She undergoes
                                        trials and tests in pursuit of that
                                        dream, usually making new friends along
                                        the way. Once she achieves that
                                        dream-which she invariably does-she is
                                        usually given a prince as a reward
                                        (notable exceptions include
                                        <em>Pocahontas</em> and
                                        <em>Brave),</em> the prince more often
                                        than not being one of the friends she
                                        has met along the way.</p>

                                        <p>If it sounds simplistic, it's
                                        because it is. No matter how much
                                        Disney animated films may appeal to
                                        adults, their target demographic is
                                        still children-and usually children
                                        under the age of twelve. For stories
                                        that are essentially morality tales,
                                        simplicity is a benefit. So the heroine
                                        states her goal within the first
                                        fifteen minutes of the movie, usually
                                        in the Menken-styled ''I want'' song,
                                        and that means that everyone in the
                                        audience knows precisely when to cheer
                                        at the end of the movie. Ariel wants to
                                        be human, so we cheer when Triton gives
                                        her her legs; Mulan wants to bring
                                        honour to her family, so we cheer when
                                        she returns home with the Emperor's
                                        gifts; Belle wants ''adventure in the
                                        great, wide somewhere'', and oh boy,
                                        does she get what she asked for.
                                        Pocahontas chooses her own path, Merida
                                        changes her fate, Tiana gets her
                                        restaurant, and so on.</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Just
                                        like every other Disney princess, Anna
                                        states what she wants very early on.
                                        She wants to find ''the one''. And,
                                        just like every other Disney princess,
                                        she gets exactly what she wants. Her
                                        renewed relationship with Elsa; the
                                        castle gates being opened for good:
                                        these are the bonus prizes. Anna's real
                                        goal is true love. We know this for
                                        certain because, just like every Disney
                                        heroine before her, she helpfully tells
                                        us so in her first scene as an adult.
                                        Her ''I want'' song is all about
                                        finding a man and falling in love; she
                                        doesn't even mention her sister. As far
                                        as I can tell, she can't get away from
                                        Elsa and everything she represents fast
                                        enough.</p>

                                        <h3>But ...but ...Anna's grown up in
                                        isolation: of course her priorities are
                                        a bit messed up!</h3>

                                        <p>No need to get defensive about it,
                                        but yes, a little social awkwardness is
                                        probably to be expected for a girl
                                        who's lived in almost total isolation
                                        for ...three years. Yes, I'm extrapolating
                                        a little here: we certainly don't see
                                        Anna interact with anyone aside from
                                        her sister and parents until Elsa's
                                        coronation. But think about it
                                        logically. After the ice incident as
                                        children, Elsa may be isolated-both by
                                        her parents and by her own fear-but
                                        there's no reason for the King and
                                        Queen to isolate Anna too. They almost
                                        certainly still have official functions
                                        to attend to: we know from Elsa's
                                        coronation that the monarch is
                                        responsible for negotiating trade
                                        arrangements and treaties, so it would
                                        be extremely irresponsible for the King
                                        and Queen to hole themselves away like
                                        their daughter. Seeing what enforced
                                        isolation does to Elsa, does it seem
                                        likely that they would force the same
                                        upon their non-powered daughter?</p>

                                        <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">It
                                        seems far more likely that Anna is only
                                        shut inside the castle long-term after
                                        her parents die, and text on the screen
                                        tells us explicitly that only three
                                        years pass between that and Elsa's
                                        coronation. Three long, lonely, boring
                                        years, I'm sure, but three years that
                                        seem to send Anna far further
                                        off-balance than lifetimes of isolation
                                        do to other Disney princesses. Unlike,
                                        say, Rapunzel, Jasmine or Aurora, Anna
                                        has spent some fifteen years of her
                                        life in relative normality, presumably
                                        experiencing culture, friendships, and
                                        perhaps even her first crush in that
                                        time: all the things a normal
                                        aristocratic teenager could expect to
                                        experience. And even in the three years
                                        spent shut in the castle, what about
                                        the servants? Given Anna's natural
                                        boisterousness, unless Arendelle is
                                        <em>really</em> classist, I find it
                                        hard to imagine she didn't interact
                                        with and even make friends among the
                                        castle staff, whom we know exist
                                        because frankly it's far more
                                        believable than Elsa and Anna doing
                                        their own laundry.</p>

                                        <p>Jasmine escapes a lifetime of
                                        solitude in the palace eager to explore
                                        the reality of Agrabah. Rapunzel spends
                                        eighteen years alone in a tower and
                                        leaves to fight her way to her own
                                        history armed with magic hair and a
                                        skillet. Even Belle compensates for her
                                        social isolation by reading voraciously
                                        about the wide world around her. Anna
                                        has to endure three years of-at
                                        worst-relative isolation, and she
                                        emerges so desperate for love that she
                                        gets engaged to literally the first
                                        young man she meets. It isn't so much
                                        ridiculous because it's a stupid thing
                                        to do; it's ridiculous because a girl
                                        that obsessed with finding love should
                                        already have a crush on a cute
