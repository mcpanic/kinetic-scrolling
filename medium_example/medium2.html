                                    <strong>SOMETHING WAS WRONG</strong> with
                                    Kai Markram. At five days old, he seemed
                                    like an unusually alert baby, picking his
                                    head up and looking around long before his
                                    sisters had done. By the time he could
                                    walk, he was always in motion and required
                                    constant attention just to ensure his
                                    safety.</p>

                                    <p>"He was super active, batteries running
                                    nonstop," says his sister, Kali. And it
                                    wasn't just boyish energy: When his parents
                                    tried to set limits, there were
                                    tantrums-not just the usual kicking and
                                    screaming, but biting and spitting, with a
                                    disproportionate and uncontrollable
                                    ferocity; and not just at age two, but at
                                    three, four, five and beyond. Kai was also
                                    socially odd: Sometimes he was withdrawn,

                                    to India, when they joined a crowd gathered
                                    around a snake charmer. Without warning,
                                    Kai, who was five at the time, darted out
                                    and tapped the deadly cobra on its

                                    frustrating for his father, one of the
                                    world's leading neuroscientists. Henry
                                    Markram is the man behind Europe's $1.3
                                    billion Human Brain Project, a gargantuan
                                    research endeavor to build a supercomputer
                                    model of the brain. Markram knows as much
                                    about the inner workings of our brains as
                                    anyone on the planet, yet he felt powerless
                                    to tackle Kai's problems.</p>

                                    <p>"As a father and a neuroscientist, you
                                    realize that you just don't know what to
                                    do," he says. In fact, Kai's behavior-which
                                    was eventually diagnosed as autism-has
                                    transformed his father's career, and helped
                                    him build a radical new theory of autism:
                                    one that upends the conventional wisdom.
                                    And, ironically, his sideline may pay off
                                    long before his brain model is even

                                    autism research circles today-but the
                                    opposite, they say. Rather than being
                                    oblivious, autistic people take in too much
                                    and learn too fast. While they may appear
                                    bereft of emotion, the Markrams insist they
                                    are actually overwhelmed not only by their
                                    own emotions, but by the emotions of

                                    autism is not just defined by its
                                    weaknesses, but also by its inherent
                                    strengths. The developmental disorder now

                                    empathy, the Markrams claim. Social
                                    difficulties and odd behavior result from
                                    trying to cope with a world that's just too

                                    became profoundly depressed and died
                                    young-he was only in his 30s, but "just
                                    went downhill and gave up"-Markram turned a
                                    corner. He'd recently been given an
                                    assignment about brain chemistry, which got
                                    him thinking. "If chemicals and the
                                    structure of the brain can change and then
                                    I change, who am I? It's a profound
                                    question. So I went to medical school and
                                    wanted to become a psychiatrist."</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Markram
                                    attended the University of Cape Town, but
                                    in his fourth year of medical school, he
                                    took a fellowship in Israel. "It was like
                                    heaven," he says, "It was all the toys that
                                    I ever could dream of to investigate the
                                    brain." He never returned to med school,
                                    and married his first wife, Anat, an
                                    Israeli, when he was 26. Soon, they had
                                    their first daughter, Linoy, now 24, then a
                                    second, Kali, now 23. Kai came four years
                                    afterwards.</p>

                                    <p>During graduate research at the Weizmann
                                    Institute in Israel, Markram made his first
                                    important discovery, elucidating a key
                                    relationship between two neurotransmitters
                                    involved in learning, acetylcholine and
                                    glutamate. The work was important and
                                    impressive-especially so early in a
                                    scientist's career-but it was what he did
                                    next that really made his name.</p>

                                    <p>During a postdoc with Nobel laureate
                                    Bert Sakmann at Germany's Max Planck
                                    Institute, Markram showed how brain cells
                                    that "fire together, wire together." That
                                    had been a basic tenet of neuroscience
                                    since the 1940s-but no one had been able to
                                    figure out how the process actually
                                    worked.</p>

                                    studying the precise timing of electrical
                                    signaling between neurons, Markram
                                    demonstrated that firing in specific
                                    patterns increases the strength of the
                                    synapses linking cells, while missing the
                                    beat weakens them. This simple mechanism
                                    allows the brain to learn, forging

                                    between various experiences and

                                    <p>Measuring these fine temporal
                                    distinctions was also a technical triumph.
                                    Sakmann won his 1991 Nobel for developing
                                    the required "patch clamp" technique, which
                                    measures the tiny changes in electrical
                                    activity inside nerve cells. To patch just
                                    one neuron, you first harvest a sliver of
                                    brain, about 1/3 of a millimeter thick and
                                    containing around 6 million neurons,
                                    typically from a freshly guillotined
                                    rat.</p>

                                    <p>To keep the tissue alive, you bubble it
                                    in oxygen, and bathe the slice of brain in
                                    a laboratory substitute for cerebrospinal
                                    fluid. Under a microscope, using a
                                    minuscule glass pipette, you carefully
                                    pierce a single cell. The technique is
                                    similar to injecting a sperm into an egg
                                    for in vitro fertilization-except that
                                    neurons are hundreds of times smaller than
                                    eggs.</p>

                                    <p>It requires steady hands and exquisite
                                    attention to detail. Markram's ultimate
                                    innovation was to build a machine that
                                    could study 12 such carefully prepared
                                    cells simultaneously, measuring their
                                    electrical and chemical interactions.
                                    Researchers who have done it say you can
                                    sometimes go a whole day without getting
                                    one right-but Markram became a master.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Still,
                                    there was a problem. He seemed to go from
                                    one career peak to another-a Fulbright at
                                    the National Institutes of Health, tenure
                                    at Weizmann, publication in the most
                                    prestigious journals-but at the same time
                                    it was becoming clear that something was
                                    not right in his youngest child's head. He
                                    studied the brain all day, but couldn't
                                    figure out how to help Kai learn and cope.
                                    As he told a <em>New York Times</em>
                                    reporter earlier this year, "You know how
                                    powerless you feel. You have this child
                                    with autism and you, even as a

                                    FIRST, MARKRAM THOUGHT</strong> Kai had
                                    attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder
                                    (ADHD): Once Kai could move, he never
                                    wanted to be still. "He was running around,
                                    very difficult to control," Markram says.
                                    As Kai grew, however, he began melting down
                                    frequently, often for no apparent reason.
                                    "He became more particular, and he started
                                    to become less hyperactive but more
                                    behaviorally difficult," Markram says.
                                    "Situations were very unpredictable. He
                                    would have tantrums. He would be very
                                    resistant to learning and to any kind of
                                    instruction."</p>

                                    <p>Preventing Kai from harming himself by
                                    running into the street or following other
                                    capricious impulses was a constant
                                    challenge. Even just trying to go to the
                                    movies became an ordeal: Kai would refuse
                                    to enter the cinema or hold his hands
                                    tightly over his ears.</p>

                                    <p>However, Kai also loved to hug people,
                                    even strangers, which is one reason it took
                                    years to get a diagnosis. That warmth made
                                    many experts rule out autism. Only after
                                    multiple evaluations was Kai finally
                                    diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, a type of
                                    autism that includes social difficulties
                                    and repetitive behaviors, but not lack of
                                    speech or profound intellectual
                                    disability.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">"We went

                                    Markram says. As a scientist who prizes
                                    rigor, this infuriated him. He'd left
                                    medical school to pursue neuroscience
                                    because he disliked psychiatry's vagueness.
                                    "I was very disappointed in how psychiatry
                                    operates," he says.</p>

                                    to understand everything," he says. "Every
                                    molecule, every gene, every cell. You can't
                                    leave anything out."</p>

                                    <p>This impatience also made him decide to
                                    study autism, beginning by reading every
                                    study and book he could get his hands on.
                                    At the time, in the 1990s, the condition
                                    was getting increased attention. The
                                    diagnosis had only been introduced into the
                                    psychiatric bible, then the <em>DSM
                                    III</em>, in 1980. The 1988 Dustin Hoffman
                                    film <em>Rain Man</em>, about an autistic
                                    savant, brought the idea that autism was
                                    both a disability and a source of quirky
                                    intelligence into the popular
                                    imagination.</p>

                                    <p>The dark days of the mid–20th century,
                                    when autism was thought to be caused by
                                    unloving "refrigerator mothers" who icily
                                    rejected their infants, were long past.
                                    However, while experts now agree that the
                                    condition is neurological, its causes
                                    remain unknown.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">The most
                                    prominent theory suggests that autism
                                    results from problems with the brain's
                                    social regions, which results in a deficit
                                    of empathy. This "theory of mind" concept
                                    was developed by Uta Frith, Alan Leslie,
                                    and Simon Baron-Cohen in the 1980s. They
                                    found that autistic children are late to
                                    develop the ability to distinguish between
                                    what they know themselves and what others
                                    know-something that other children learn
                                    early on.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">In a now
                                    famous experiment, children watched two
                                    puppets, "Sally" and "Anne." Sally has a
                                    marble, which she places in a basket and
                                    then leaves. While she's gone, Anne moves
                                    Sally's marble into a box. By age four or
                                    five, normal children can predict that
                                    Sally will look for the marble in the
                                    basket first because she doesn't know that
                                    Anne moved it. But until they are much
                                    older, most autistic children say that
                                    Sally will look in the box because <em>they
                                    know</em> it's there. While typical
                                    children automatically adopt Sally's point
                                    of view and know she was out of the room
                                    when Anne hid the marble, autistic children
                                    have much more difficulty thinking this
                                    way.</p>

                                    <p>This apparent social indifference was
                                    viewed as central to the condition.
                                    Unfortunately, the theory also seemed to
                                    imply that autistic people are uncaring
                                    because they don't easily recognize that
                                    other people exist as intentional agents
                                    who can be loved, thwarted or hurt. But
                                    while the Sally-Anne experiment shows that
                                    autistic people have difficulty knowing
                                    that other people have different
                                    perspectives-what researchers call
                                    cognitive empathy or "theory of mind"-it
                                    doesn't show that they don't care when
                                    someone is hurt or feeling pain, whether
                                    emotional or physical. In terms of
                                    caring-technically called affective
                                    empathy-autistic people aren't necessarily
                                    impaired.</p>

                                    <p>Sadly, however, the two different kinds
                                    of empathy are combined in one English
                                    word. And so, since the 1980s, this idea
                                    that autistic people "lack empathy" has
                                    taken hold.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">"When we
                                    looked at the autism field we couldn't
                                    believe it," Markram says. "Everybody was
                                    looking at it as if they have no empathy,
                                    no theory of mind. And actually Kai, as
                                    awkward as he was, saw through you. He had
                                    a much deeper understanding of what really
                                    was your intention." And he wanted social

                                    obvious thought was: Maybe Kai's not really
                                    autistic? But by the time Markram was fully
                                    up to speed in the literature, he was
                                    convinced that Kai had been correctly
                                    diagnosed. He'd learned enough to know that
                                    the rest of his son's behavior was too
                                    classically autistic to be dismissed as a
                                    misdiagnosis, and there was no alternative
                                    condition that explained as much of his
                                    behavior and tendencies. And accounts by
                                    unquestionably autistic people, like
                                    bestselling memoirist and animal scientist
                                    Temple Grandin, raised similar challenges
                                    to the notion that autistic people could
                                    never really see beyond themselves.</p>

                                    <p>Markram began to do autism work himself
                                    as visiting professor at the University of
                                    California, San Francisco in 1999.
                                    Colleague Michael Merzenich, a
                                    neuroscientist, proposed that autism is
                                    caused by an imbalance between inhibitory
                                    and excitatory neurons. A failure of
                                    inhibitions that tamp down impulsive
                                    actions might explain behavior like Kai's
                                    sudden move to pat the cobra. Markram
                                    started his research there.</p>

                                    publishing firm, Frontiers, with a network

                                    The Doors.</p>

                                    <p>When asked whether she had ever worried
                                    about marrying a man whose child had severe
                                    behavioral problems, she responds as though
                                    the question never occurred to her. "I knew
                                    about the challenges with Kai," she says,
                                    "Back then, he was quite impulsive and very
                                    difficult to steer."</p>

                                    <p>The first time they spent a day
                                    together, Kai was seven or eight. "I
                                    probably had some blue marks and bites on
                                    my arms because he was really quite
                                    something. He would just go off and do
                                    something dangerous, so obviously you would
                                    have to get in rescue mode," she says,
                                    noting that he'd sometimes walk directly
                                    into traffic. "It was difficult to manage
                                    the behavior," she shrugs, "But if you were
                                    nice with him then he was usually nice with
                                    you as well."</p>

                                    <p>"Kamila was amazing with Kai," says
                                    Markram, "She was much more systematic and
                                    could lay out clear rules. She helped him a
                                    lot. We never had that thing that you see
                                    in the movies where they don't like their

                                    <p>At the Swiss Federal Institute of
                                    Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), the couple
                                    soon began collaborating on autism
                                    research. "Kamila and I spoke about it a
                                    lot," Markram says, adding that they were
                                    both "frustrated" by the state of the
                                    science and at not being able to help more.
                                    Their now-shared parental interest fused
                                    with their scientific drives.</p>

                                    <p>They started by studying the brain at
                                    the circuitry level. Markram assigned a
                                    graduate student, Tania Rinaldi Barkat, to
                                    look for the best animal model, since such
                                    research cannot be done on humans.</p>

                                    <p>Barkat happened to drop by Kamila's
                                    office while I was there, a decade after
                                    she had moved on to other research. She
                                    greeted her former colleagues
                                    enthusiastically.</p>

                                    <p>She started her graduate work with the
                                    Markrams by searching the literature for
                                    prospective animal models. They agreed that
                                    the one most like human autism involved
                                    rats prenatally exposed to an epilepsy drug
                                    called valproic acid (VPA; brand name,
                                    Depakote). Like other "autistic" rats, VPA
                                    rats show aberrant social behavior and
                                    increased repetitive behaviors like
                                    excessive self-grooming.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">But more
                                    significant is that when pregnant
                                    <em>women</em> take high doses of VPA,
                                    which is sometimes necessary for seizure
                                    control, studies have found that the risk
                                    of autism in their children increases
                                    <em>sevenfold.</em> One 2005 study found
                                    that close to 9 percent of these children
                                    have autism.</p>

                                    <p>Because VPA has a link to human autism,
                                    it seemed plausible that its cellular
                                    effects in animals would be similar. A
                                    neuroscientist who has studied VPA rats
                                    once told me, "I see it not as a model, but
                                    as a recapitulation of the disease in other
                                    species."</p>

                                    <p>Barkat got to work. Earlier research
                                    showed that the timing and dose of exposure
                                    was critical: Different timing could
                                    produce opposite symptoms, and large doses
                                    sometimes caused physical deformities. The
                                    "best" time to cause autistic symptoms in
                                    rats is embryonic day 12, so that's when
                                    Barkat dosed them.</p>

                                    <p>At first, the work was exasperating. For
                                    two years, Barkat studied inhibitory
                                    neurons from the VPA rat cortex, using the
                                    same laborious patch-clamping technique
                                    perfected by Markram years earlier. If
                                    these cells were less active, that would
                                    confirm the imbalance that Merzenich had
                                    theorized.</p>

                                    <p>She went through the repetitious
                                    preparation, making delicate patches to
                                    study inhibitory networks. But after two
                                    years of this technically demanding,
                                    sometimes tedious, and time-consuming work,
                                    Barkat had nothing to show for it.</p>

                                    <p>"I just found no difference at all," she
                                    told me, "It looked completely normal." She
                                    continued to patch cell after cell, going
                                    through the exacting procedure
                                    endlessly-but still saw no abnormalities.
                                    At least she was becoming proficient at the
                                    technique, she told herself.</p>

                                    <p>Markram was ready to give up, but Barkat
                                    demurred, saying she would like to shift
                                    her focus from inhibitory to excitatory VPA
                                    cell networks. It was there that she struck
                                    gold.</p>

                                    <p>"There was a difference in the
                                    excitability of the whole network," she
                                    says, reliving her enthusiasm. The
                                    networked VPA cells responded nearly twice
                                    as strongly as normal-and they were
                                    hyper-connected. If a normal cell had
                                    connections to ten other cells, a VPA cell
                                    connected with twenty. Nor were they
                                    under-responsive. Instead, they were
                                    hyperactive, which isn't necessarily a
                                    defect: A more responsive, better-connected
                                    network learns faster.</p>

                                    <p>But what did this mean for autistic
                                    people? While Barkat was investigating the
                                    cortex, Kamila Markram had been observing
                                    the rats' behavior, noting high levels of
                                    anxiety as compared to normal rats. "It was
                                    pretty much a gold mine then," Markram
                                    says. The difference was striking. "You
                                    could basically see it with the eye. The
                                    VPAs were different and they behaved
                                    differently," Markram says. They were
                                    quicker to get frightened, and faster at
                                    learning what to fear, but slower to
                                    discover that a once-threatening situation
                                    was now safe.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">While
                                    ordinary rats get scared of an electrified
                                    grid where they are shocked when a
                                    particular tone sounds, VPA rats come to
                                    fear not just that tone, but the whole grid
                                    and everything connected with it-like
                                    colors, smells, and other clearly
                                    distinguishable beeps.</p>

                                    conditioning was really hugely amplified,"
                                    Markram says. "We then looked at the cell
                                    response in the amygdala and again they
                                    were hyper-reactive, so it made a beautiful

                                    emotional systems might explain both

                                    they realized. After all, the problem with
                                    VPA rats isn't that they can't learn-it's
                                    that they learn too quickly, with too much
                                    fear, and irreversibly.</p>

                                    <p>They thought back to Kai's experiences:
                                    how he used to cover his ears and resist
                                    going to the movies, hating the loud
                                    sounds; his limited diet and apparent
                                    terror of trying new foods.</p>

                                    <p>"He remembers exactly where he sat at
                                    exactly what restaurant one time when he
                                    tried for hours to get himself to eat a
                                    salad," Kamila says, recalling that she'd
                                    promised him something he'd really wanted
                                    if he did so. Still, he couldn't make
                                    himself try even the smallest piece of
                                    lettuce. That was clearly
                                    overgeneralization of fear.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">The
                                    Markrams reconsidered Kai's meltdowns, too,
                                    wondering if they'd been prompted by
                                    overwhelming experiences. They saw that
                                    identifying Kai's specific sensitivities
                                    preemptively might prevent tantrums by
                                    allowing him to leave upsetting situations
                                    or by mitigating his distress before it
                                    became intolerable. The idea of an intense
                                    world had immediate practical

                                    data also suggested that autism isn't
                                    limited to a single brain network. In VPA
                                    rat brains, both the amygdala and the

                                    external stimuli. So maybe, the Markrams
                                    decided, autistic social difficulties

                                    perhaps they are the result of total

                                    of relentless and unpredictable sensation.
                                    An overwhelmed infant might, not
                                    surprisingly, attempt to escape. Kamila
                                    compares it to being sleepless, jetlagged,
                                    and hung over, all at once. "If you don't
                                    sleep for a night or two, everything hurts.
                                    The lights hurt. The noises hurt. You
                                    withdraw," she says.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Unlike
                                    adults, however, babies can't flee. All
                                    they can do is cry and rock, and, later,
                                    try to avoid touch, eye contact, and other
                                    powerful experiences. Autistic children
                                    might revel in patterns and predictability
                                    just to make sense of the chaos.</p>

                                    <p>At the same time, if infants withdraw to
                                    try to cope, they will miss what's known as
                                    a "sensitive period"-a developmental phase
                                    when the brain is particularly responsive
                                    to, and rapidly assimilates, certain kinds
                                    of external stimulation. That can cause
                                    lifelong problems.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Language
                                    learning is a classic example: If babies
                                    aren't exposed to speech during their first
                                    three years, their verbal abilities can be
                                    permanently stunted. Historically, this
                                    created a spurious link between deafness
                                    and intellectual disability: Before deaf
                                    babies were taught sign language at a young
                                    age, they would often have lasting language
                                    deficits. Their problem wasn't defective
                                    "language areas," though-it was that they
                                    had been denied linguistic stimuli at a
                                    critical time. (Incidentally, the same
                                    phenomenon accounts for why learning a
                                    second language is easy for small children
                                    and hard for virtually everyone else.)</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">This has
                                    profound implications for autism. If
                                    autistic babies tune out when overwhelmed,
                                    their social and language difficulties may
                                    arise not from damaged brain regions, but
                                    because critical data is drowned out by
                                    noise or missed due to attempts to escape
                                    at a time when the brain actually needs
                                    this input.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">The
                                    intense world could also account for the
                                    tragic similarities between autistic
                                    children and abused and neglected infants.
                                    Severely maltreated children often rock,
                                    avoid eye contact, and have social
                                    problems-just like autistic children. These
                                    parallels led to decades of blaming the
                                    parents of autistic children, including the
                                    infamous "refrigerator mother." But if
                                    those behaviors are coping mechanisms,
                                    autistic people might engage in them not
                                    because of maltreatment, but because
                                    ordinary experience is overwhelming or even
                                    traumatic.</p>

                                    Markrams teased out further implications:
                                    Social problems may not be a defining or
                                    even fixed feature of autism. Early
                                    intervention to reduce or moderate the
                                    <em>intensity</em> of an autistic child's
                                    environment might allow their talents to be
                                    protected while their autism-related
                                    disabilities are mitigated or, possibly,
                                    avoided.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">The VPA
                                    model also captures other paradoxical
                                    autistic traits. For example, while
                                    oversensitivities are most common, autistic
                                    people are also frequently
                                    <em>under-</em>reactive to pain. The same
                                    is true of VPA rats. In addition, one of
                                    the most consistent findings in autism is
                                    abnormal brain growth, particularly in the
                                    cortex. There, studies find an excess of
                                    circuits called mini-columns, which can be
                                    seen as the brain's microprocessors. VPA
                                    rats also exhibit this excess.</p>

                                    <strong>THE MARKRAMS' FIRST
                                    PUBLICATION</strong> of their intense world
                                    research appeared in 2007: a paper on the
                                    VPA rat in the <em>Proceedings of the
                                    National Academy of Sciences.</em> This was
                                    followed by an overview in <em>Frontiers in
                                    Neuroscience.</em> The next year, at the
                                    Society for Neuroscience (SFN), the field's
                                    biggest meeting, a symposium was held on
                                    the topic. In 2010, they updated and
                                    expanded their ideas in a second
                                    <em>Frontiers</em> paper.</p>

                                    <p>Since then, more than three dozen papers
                                    have been published by other groups on VPA
                                    rodents, replicating and extending the
                                    Markrams' findings. At this year's SFN, at
                                    least five new studies were presented on
                                    VPA autism models. The sensory aspects of
                                    autism have long been neglected, but the
                                    intense world and VPA rats are bringing it
                                    to the fore.</p>

                                    <p>Nevertheless, reaction from colleagues
                                    in the field has been cautious. One
                                    exception is Laurent Mottron, professor of
                                    psychiatry and head of autism research at
                                    the University of Montreal. He was the
                                    first to highlight perceptual differences
                                    as critical in autism-even before the
                                    Markrams. Only a minority of researchers
                                    even studied sensory issues before him.
                                    Almost everyone else focused on social
                                    problems.</p>

                                    <p>But when Mottron first proposed that
                                    autism is linked with what he calls
                                    "enhanced perceptual functioning," he, like
                                    most experts, viewed this as the
                                    consequence of a deficit. The idea was that
                                    the apparently superior perception
                                    exhibited by some autistic people is caused
                                    by problems with higher level brain
                                    functioning-and it had historically been
                                    dismissed as mere"splinter skills," not a
                                    sign of genuine intelligence. Autistic
                                    savants had earlier been known as "idiot
                                    savants," the implication being that,
                                    unlike "real" geniuses, they didn't have
                                    any creative control of their exceptional
                                    minds. Mottron described it this way in a
                                    review paper: "[A]utistics were not
                                    displaying atypical perceptual strengths
                                    but a failure to form global or high level
                                    representations."</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">However,
                                    Mottron's research led him to see this view
                                    as incorrect. His own and other studies
                                    showed superior performance by autistic
                                    people not only in "low level" sensory
                                    tasks, like better detection of musical
                                    pitch and greater ability to perceive
                                    certain visual information, but also in
                                    cognitive tasks like pattern finding in
                                    visual IQ tests.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">In fact,
                                    it has long been clear that detecting and
                                    manipulating complex systems is an autistic
                                    strength-so much so that the autistic
                                    genius has become a Silicon Valley
                                    stereotype. In May, for example, the German
                                    software firm SAP announced plans to hire
                                    650 autistic people because of their
                                    exceptional abilities. Mathematics, musical
                                    virtuosity, and scientific achievement all
                                    require understanding and playing with
                                    systems, patterns, and structure. Both
                                    autistic people and their family members
                                    are over-represented in these fields, which
                                    suggests genetic influences.</p>

                                    <p>"Our points of view are in different
                                    areas [of research,] but we arrive at ideas
                                    that are really consistent," says Mottron
                                    of the Markrams and their intense world
                                    theory. (He also notes that while they
                                    study cell physiology, he images actual
                                    human brains.)</p>

                                    <p>Because Henry Markram came from outside
                                    the field and has an autistic son, Mottron
                                    adds, "He could have an original point of
                                    view and not be influenced by all the
                                    clichés," particularly those that saw
                                    talents as defects. "I'm very much in
                                    sympathy with what they do," he says,
                                    although he is not convinced that they have
                                    proven all the details.</p>

                                    <p>Mottron's support is unsurprising, of
                                    course, because the intense world dovetails
                                    with his own findings. But even one of the
                                    creators of the "theory of mind" concept
                                    finds much of it plausible.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Simon
                                    Baron-Cohen, who directs the Autism
                                    Research Centre at Cambridge University,
                                    told me, "I am open to the idea that the
                                    social deficits in autism-like problems
                                    with the cognitive aspects of empathy,
                                    which is also known as ‘theory of mind'-may
                                    be upstream from a more basic sensory
                                    abnormality." In other words, the Markrams'
                                    physiological model could be the cause, and
                                    the social deficits he studies, the effect.
                                    He adds that the VPA rat is an
                                    "interesting" model. However, he also notes
                                    that most autism is not caused by VPA and
                                    that it's possible that sensory and social
                                    defects co-occur, rather than one causing
                                    the other.</p>

                                    <p>His collaborator, Uta Frith, professor
                                    of cognitive development at University
                                    College London, is not convinced. "It just
                                    doesn't do it for me," she says of the
                                    intense world theory. "I don't want to say
                                    it's rubbish," she says, "but I think they
                                    try to explain too much."</p>

                                    fought to get sensory problems added to the

                                    <p>Steve Silberman, who is writing a
                                    history of autism titled <em>NeuroTribes:
                                    Thinking Smarter About People Who Think
                                    Differently</em>, says, "We had 70 years of
                                    autism research [based] on the notion that
                                    autistic people have brain deficits.
                                    Instead, the intense world postulates that
                                    autistic people feel <em>too much</em> and
                                    sense <em>too much.</em> That's valuable,
                                    because I think the deficit model did
                                    tremendous injury to autistic people and
                                    their families, and also misled
                                    science."</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Priscilla
                                    Gilman, the mother of an autistic child, is
                                    also enthusiastic. Her memoir, <em>The
                                    Anti-Romantic Child</em>, describes her
                                    son's diagnostic odyssey. Before Benjamin
                                    was in preschool, Gilman took him to the
                                    Yale Child Study Center for a full
                                    evaluation. At the time, he did not display
                                    any classic signs of autism, but he did
                                    seem to be a candidate for hyperlexia-at
                                    age two-and-a-half, he could read aloud
                                    from his mother's doctoral dissertation
                                    with perfect intonation and fluency. Like
                                    other autistic talents, hyperlexia is often
                                    dismissed as a "splinter" strength.</p>

                                    <p>At that time, Yale experts ruled autism
                                    out, telling Gilman that Benjamin "is not a
                                    candidate because he is too ‘warm' and too
                                    ‘related,'" she recalls. Kai Markram's hugs
                                    had similarly been seen as disqualifying.
                                    At twelve years of age, however, Benjamin
                                    was officially diagnosed with Autism
                                    Spectrum Disorder.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">According
                                    to the intense world perspective, however,
                                    warmth isn't incompatible with autism. What
                                    looks like antisocial behavior results from
                                    being too affected by others' emotions-the
                                    opposite of indifference.</p>

                                    <p>Indeed, research on typical children and
                                    adults finds that too much distress can
                                    dampen ordinary empathy as well. When
                                    someone else's pain becomes too unbearable
                                    to witness, even typical people withdraw
                                    and try to soothe themselves first rather
                                    than helping-exactly like autistic people.
                                    It's just that autistic people become
                                    distressed more easily, and so their
                                    reactions appear atypical.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">"The
                                    overwhelmingness of understanding how
                                    people feel can lead to either what is
                                    perceived as inappropriate emotional
                                    response, or to what is perceived as
                                    shutting down, which people see as lack of
                                    empathy," says Emily Willingham. Willingham
                                    is a biologist and the mother of an
                                    autistic child; she also suspects that she
                                    herself has Asperger syndrome. But rather
                                    than being unemotional, she says, autistic
                                    people are "taking it all in like a tsunami
                                    of emotion that they feel on behalf of
                                    others. Going internal is protective."</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">At least
                                    one study supports this idea, showing that
                                    while autistic people score lower on
                                    cognitive tests of
                                    perspective-taking-recall Anne, Sally, and
                                    the missing marble-they are <em>more</em>
                                    affected than typical folks by other
                                    people's feelings. "I have three children,
                                    and my autistic child is my most
                                    empathetic," Priscilla Gilman says, adding
                                    that when her mother first read about the
                                    intense world, she said, "This explains
                                    Benjamin."</p>

                                    wears a sky blue hoodie, his gray Chuck
                                    Taylor–style sneakers carefully unlaced at
                                    the top. "My rapper sneakers," he says,
                                    smiling. He speaks Hebrew and English and
                                    lives with his mother in Israel, attending
                                    a school for people with learning
                                    disabilities near Rehovot. His manner is
                                    unselfconscious, though sometimes he scowls
                                    abruptly without explanation. But when he
                                    speaks, it is obvious that he wants to
                                    connect, even when he can't answer a
                                    question. Asked if he thinks he sees things
                                    differently than others do, he says, "I
                                    <em>feel</em> them different."</p>

                                    <p>He waits in the Markrams' living room as
                                    they prepare to take him out for dinner.
                                    Henry's aunt and uncle are here, too.
                                    They've been living with the family to help
                                    care for its newest additions:
                                    nine-month-old Charlotte and Olivia, who is
                                    one-and-a-half years old.</p>

                                    <p>"It's our big patchwork family," says
                                    Kamila, noting that when they visit Israel,
                                    they typically stay with Henry's ex-wife's
                                    family, and that she stays with them in
                                    Lausanne. They all travel constantly, which
                                    has created a few problems now and then.
                                    None of them will ever forget a tantrum Kai
                                    had when he was younger, which got him
                                    barred from a KLM flight. A delay upset him
                                    so much that he kicked, screamed, and
                                    spat.</p>

                                    <p>Now, however, he rarely melts down. A
                                    combination of family and school support,
                                    an antipsychotic medication that he's been
                                    taking recently, and increased
                                    understanding of his sensitivities has
                                    mitigated the disabilities Kai associated
                                    with his autism.</p>

                                    <p>"I was a bad boy. I always was hitting
                                    and doing a lot of trouble," Kai says of
                                    his past. "I was really bad because I
                                    didn't know what to do. But I grew up." His
                                    relatives nod in agreement. Kai has made
                                    tremendous strides, though his parents
                                    still think that his brain has far greater
                                    capacity than is evident in his speech and
                                    schoolwork.</p>

                                    <p>As the Markrams see it, if autism
                                    results from a hyper-responsive brain, the
                                    most sensitive brains are actually the most
                                    likely to be disabled by our intense world.
                                    But if autistic people can learn to filter
                                    the blizzard of data, especially early in
                                    life, then those most vulnerable to the
                                    most severe autism might prove to be the
                                    most gifted of all.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Markram
                                    sees this in Kai. "It's not a mental
                                    retardation," he says, "He's handicapped,
                                    absolutely, but something is going crazy in
                                    his brain. It's a hyper disorder. It's like
                                    he's got an amplification of many of my
                                    quirks."</p>

                                    <p>One of these involves an insistence on
                                    timeliness. "If I say that something has to
                                    happen," he says, "I can become quite
                                    difficult. <em>It has to happen at that
                                    time.</em>"</p>

                                    <p>He adds, "For me it's an asset, because
                                    it means that I deliver. If I say I'll do
                                    something, I do it." For Kai, however,
                                    anticipation and planning run wild. When he
                                    travels, he obsesses about every move, over
                                    and over, long in advance. "He will sit
                                    there and plan, okay, when he's going to
                                    get up. He will execute. You know he will
                                    get on that plane come hell or high water,"
                                    Markram says. "But he actually loses the
                                    entire day. It's like an extreme version of
                                    my quirks, where for me they are an asset
                                    and for him they become a handicap."</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">If this is
                                    true, autistic people have incredible
                                    unrealized potential. Say Kai's brain was
                                    even more finely tuned than his father's,
                                    then it might give him the capacity to be
                                    even more brilliant. Consider Markram's
                                    visual skills. Like Temple Grandin, whose
                                    first autism memoir was titled <em>Thinking
                                    In Pictures</em>, he has stunning visual
                                    abilities. "I see what I think," he says,
                                    adding that when he considers a scientific
                                    or mathematical problem, "I can see how
                                    things are supposed to look. If it's not
                                    there, I can actually simulate it forward
                                    in time."</p>

                                    <p>At the offices of Markram's Human Brain
                                    Project, visitors are given a taste of what
                                    it might feel like to inhabit such a mind.
                                    In a small screening room furnished with
                                    sapphire-colored, tulip-shaped chairs, I'm
                                    handed 3-D glasses. The instant the lights
                                    dim, I'm zooming through a brightly colored
                                    forest of neurons so detailed and thick
                                    that they appear to be velvety, inviting to
                                    the touch.</p>

                                    simulation feels so real and enveloping
                                    that it is hard to pay attention to the
                                    narration, which includes mind-blowing
                                    facts about the project. But it is also
                                    dizzying, overwhelming. If this is just a
                                    smidgen of what ordinary life is like for
                                    Kai it's easier to see how hard his early
                                    life must have been. That's the paradox
                                    about autism and empathy. The problem may
                                    not be that autistic people can't
                                    understand typical people's points of
                                    view-but that typical people can't imagine
                                    autism.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">Critics of
                                    the intense world theory are dismayed and
                                    put off by this idea of hidden talent in
                                    the most severely disabled. They see it as
                                    wishful thinking, offering false hope to
                                    parents who want to see their children in
                                    the best light and to autistic people who
                                    want to fight the stigma of autism. In some
                                    types of autism, they say, intellectual
                                    disability is just that.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">"The maxim
                                    is, ‘If you've seen one person with autism,
                                    you've seen one person with autism,'" says
                                    Matthew Belmonte, an autism researcher
                                    affiliated with the Groden Center in Rhode
                                    Island. The assumption should be that
                                    autistic people have intelligence that may
                                    not be easily testable, he says, but it can
                                    still be highly variable.</p>

                                    <p>He adds, "Biologically, autism is not a
                                    unitary condition. Asking at the biological
                                    level ‘What causes autism?' makes about as
                                    much sense as asking a mechanic ‘Why does
                                    my car not start?' There are many possible
                                    reasons." Belmonte believes that the
                                    intense world may account for some forms of
                                    autism, but not others.</p>

                                    <p>Kamila, however, insists that the data
                                    suggests that the most disabled are also
                                    the most gifted. "If you look from the
                                    physiological or connectivity point of
                                    view, those brains are the most

                                    intense-world adherents don't yet know how
                                    or even if the right early intervention can
                                    reduce disability.</p>

                                    secret-ability idea also worries autistic

                                    contains the seeds of a different stigma.
                                    "We agree that autistic people do have a
                                    number of cognitive advantages and it's
                                    valuable to do research on that," he says.
                                    But, he stresses, "People have worth

                                    abilities. If society accepts us only

                                    research suggests that autism can be

                                    repetitive, and safe introduction of new
                                    material seems to cause improvement.</p>

                                    <p>In humans, the idea would be to keep the
                                    brain's circuitry calm when it is most
                                    vulnerable, during those critical periods
                                    in infancy and toddlerhood. "With this
                                    intensity, the circuits are going to lock
                                    down and become rigid," says Markram. "You
                                    want to avoid that, because to undo it is
                                    very difficult."</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">For
                                    autistic children, intervening early might
                                    mean improvements in learning language and
                                    socializing. While it's already clear that
                                    early interventions can reduce autistic
                                    disability, they typically don't integrate
                                    intense-world insights. The behavioral
                                    approach that is most popular-Applied
                                    Behavior Analysis-rewards compliance with
                                    "normal" behavior, rather than seeking to
                                    understand what drives autistic actions and
                                    attacking the disabilities at their
                                    inception.</p>

                                    <p>Research shows, in fact, that everyone
                                    learns best when receiving just the right
                                    dose of challenge-not so little that
                                    they're bored, not so much that they're
                                    overwhelmed; not in the comfort zone, and
                                    not in the panic zone, either. That sweet
                                    spot may be different in autism. But
                                    according to the Markrams, it is different
                                    in degree, not kind.</p>

                                    <p>Markram suggests providing a gentle,
                                    predictable environment. "It's almost like
                                    the fourth trimester," he says.</p>

                                    <p class="notes-source-hasnotes">
                                    <strong>"</strong>To prevent the circuits
                                    from becoming locked into fearful states or
                                    behavioral patterns you need a filtered
                                    environment from as early as possible,"
                                    Markram explains. "I think that if you can
                                    avoid that, then those circuits would get
                                    locked into having the flexibility that
                                    comes with security."</p>

                                    always the unseen enemy. Having a dog in
                                    the fight means you may bend the rules to
                                    favor it, whether deliberately or simply
                                    because we're wired to ignore inconvenient
                                    truths. In fact, the entire scientific
                                    method can be seen as a series of attempts
                                    to drive out bias: The double-blind
                                    controlled trial exists because both
                                    patients and doctors tend to see what they
                                    want to see-improvement.</p>

                                    <p>At the same time, the best scientists
                                    are driven by passions that cannot be
                                    anything but deeply personal. The Markrams
                                    are open about the fact that their
                                    subjective experience with Kai influences
                                    their work.</p>

                                    <p>But that doesn't mean that they
                                    disregard the scientific process. The
                                    couple could easily deal with many of the
                                    intense world critiques by simply arguing
                                    that their theory only applies to
                                    <em>some</em> cases of autism. That would
                                    make it much more difficult to disprove.
                                    But that's not the route they've chosen to
                                    take. In their 2010 paper, they list a
                                    series of possible findings that would
                                    invalidate the intense world, including
                                    discovering human cases where the relevant
                                    brain circuits are not hyper-reactive, or
                                    discovering that such excessive
                                    responsiveness doesn't lead to deficiencies
                                    in memory, perception, or emotion. So far,
                                    however, the known data has been
                                    supportive.</p>

                                    <p>But whether or not the intense world
                                    accounts for all or even most cases of
                                    autism, the theory already presents a major
                                    challenge to the idea that the condition is
                                    primarily a lack of empathy, or a social
                                    disorder. Intense world theory confronts
                                    the stigmatizing stereotypes that have
                                    framed autistic strengths as defects, or at
                                    least as less significant because of
                                    associated weaknesses.</p>
